@0    = ~So, you're ready to leave now, <CHARNAME>?~
@1    = ~Yes, let's go.~
@2    = ~Not quite. Just wait here for now.~
@3    = ~I've changed my mind. I don't think I need you in the party.~
@4    = ~(sigh) If you say so. When you do need me, you know where I'll be.~
@5    = ~Have you changed your mind about having me in your group, <CHARNAME>? I certainly hope so.~
@6    = ~Yes, I think you'll be a welcome addition.~
@7    = ~No, I don't need you in the group just yet.~
@8    = ~Good. You won't be disappointed, I promise.~
@9    = ~But first you must understand that although I am now bound to discover all I can about this rival guild, my first loyalty lies with rescuing my friend Imoen from the Cowled Wizards.~
@10   = ~But first I must inform you that although I am working with Aran to uncover this rival guild, my main goal is to pursue the mage Irenicus and make him pay for all he has done to me.~
@11   = ~Good. Let's go.~
@12   = ~Well, in my turn, I promise that although *my* first loyalty must necessarily belong to Aran and my guild, I will do everything I can to help you. Come on, it's time we were off.~
@13   = ~(Suddenly, Fade is standing before you again, looking bewildered and dangerously near collapse)~
@14   = ~(As you cradle her in your arms, you feel her breathing become shallow again, and she begins to twitch)~
@15   = ~(hold her even closer to you)~
@16   = ~(whisper) Fade, don't leave me! I need you... I love you... ~
@17   = ~Fade, don't you dare leave me! Come on, girl, fight it!~
@18   = ~(She continues to twitch, and it seems as if she is trying to say something to you. Listening carefully, you can just make out one sentence) Don't leave me... ~
@19   = ~I won't leave you! Fade, please, don't leave me. I need you... I love you... ~
@20   = ~(whisper) Love... you... ~
@21   = ~(gasp) No! (She holds on to you tightly) Not... leaving! (She screams again and then slumps in your arms, exhausted)~
@22   = ~(shake her) Fade, are you okay? Please tell me you're okay!~
@23   = ~Sweet one, it's alright... please be alright... ~
@24   = ~(She grimaces as if in pain, but nods) Fight! Yes... fight... ~
@25   = ~(Fade lies still in your arms for a moment, and you are unsure if she has won. Then, much to your relief, you feel her wrap her arms around your neck) Don't shake me... I ache... ~
@26   = ~(Her eyes flutter open) I... I cannot believe it... I am still here! You fought for me again, <CHARNAME>... ~
@27   = ~Of course I did. I couldn't leave you with that demon inside you. I had to get you back. I love you.~
@28   = ~Of course, but don't ever do anything like that again! You damn near gave me a heart attack!~
@29   = ~(say nothing, just kiss her)~
@30   = ~(Fade lies still in your arms for a moment, and you are unsure if she has won. Then, much to your relief, you feel her wrap her arms around your neck)~
@31   = ~I love you too. I just couldn't stop it... the demonic spirit took advantage of my weakened state and used me against you! I tried to fight back, but it was too strong.~
@32   = ~It... it taunted me, saying that I would have to witness your death, that it would devour you--and I couldn't stop it! I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, so very sorry... ~
@33   = ~Shhhh--you have nothing to be sorry about. Let's just go. Imoen is restored and I have you back, and that is all that matters.~
@34   = ~I... I couldn't help it, <CHARNAME>. I tried to fight it, but it was too strong. After Bodhi had bitten me, I was weakened. The spirit took advantage of that, and so was able to use me against you.~
@35   = ~It taunted me, saying that I would have to witness your death at its--and therefore at my--hands. I couldn't stop it! I'm sorry... so very sorry... ~
@36   = ~Shhh--you don't need to apologize. Let's just go. Imoen is restored and I have you back, and that is all that matters.~
@37   = ~(She accepts your kiss with an urgency bordering on fervor. When you break apart, she buries her face into your shoulder and holds on to you as if her life depended on it) Thank you for not abandoning me.~
@38   = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

While I had feared for some time that Bodhi's final revenge on me would be to take away Fade forever, things have turned out all right after all. The vampiric curse has been removed, the demon has been banished, and Fade seems not to have suffered any lasting damage.~
@39   = ~Yes. (She buries her face into your shoulder and holds on to you as if her life depended on it) Thank you for not abandoning me.~
@40   = ~You'd better go and speak to the Shadow Master first. He's not altogether... happy with how things have turned out.~
@41   = ~Come on, <CHARNAME>. We'd better hurry up and find those two contacts.~
@42   = ~(On entering the room, you find Fade huddled in a corner, blindfolded with her wrists bound, clad only in her underclothes. As you step towards her, she shrinks back from you, growling)~
@43   = ~Get away from me!~
@44   = ~Shhh... Fade, it's me, <CHARNAME>. I've come here to rescue you.~
@45   = ~<CHARNAME>? Is it really... you?~
@46   = ~(She crawls awkwardly from the corner, and as she emerges from the shadows, you cannot help but wince at the obvious bruising to her face and body. Someone has beaten her--badly)~
@47   = ~Yes, it's me. Come on, let's untie you and get that blindfold off.~
@48   = ~Ye Gods, Fade. What happened to you?!~
@49   = ~(As you get closer, you can now see the true extent of her injuries. Removing her blindfold, she winces, and it's obvious why--the left side of her face is swollen and bloody, her left eye is closed, and her lip split. As you untie her wrists, she looks at you with her good eye, and then looks away)~
@50   = ~Those bastards... let me take a look at that.~
@51   = ~(try to put an arm around her)~
@52   = ~Well... Shall we get moving?~
@53   = ~I fought back.~
@54   = ~Oh. I... see. Come on, let's untie you and get that blindfold off.~
@55   = ~No! I'll... I'll be okay. Let's... let's just get going.~
@56   = ~Well... all right.~
@57   = ~Fade, I really think you should have those injuries seen to.~
@58   = ~(As you try to put your arms around her, she shoves you away rather viciously) Let's just get going.~
@59   = ~Fade, at least let me look at your injuries.~
@60   = ~Fade! Why did you do that?~
@61   = ~(Walking with a pronounced limp, she makes her way to the door. On seeing Mallon's body, a scream of primal fury erupts from her throat, and she throws herself at the corpse. You cannot understand a word she says--you suspect it is a mixture of Abyssal, Elven and pure rage--as she tears at the corpse with her bare hands)~
@62   = ~(try to pull her from Mallon's corpse) Fade!~
@63   = ~(let her vent her rage on the corpse)~
@64   = ~(She shakes her head vehemently, and walking with a pronounced limp, makes her way to the door. On seeing Mallon's body, a scream of primal fury erupts from her throat, and she throws herself at the corpse. You cannot understand a word she says--you suspect it is a mixture of Abyssal, elven and pure rage--as she tears at the corpse with her bare hands)~
@65   = ~I don't need your pity! Now let's just get out of here!~
@66   = ~(In her rage, she turns and swings a fist wildly at you, catching you a glancing blow on the chin)~
@67   = ~(leave her alone and let her vent her rage on the corpse)~
@68   = ~You punched me! Right, that's enough! (grab her wrists and continue to try to drag her away from the corpse)~
@69   = ~(It doesn't take her long to reduce the corpse to a bloody pulp, and with a shuddering gasp, she stands up, shaking, covered from head to toe in blood and gore. Then, to your surprise, she laughs)~
@70   = ~Dead! May you rot in hell, Mallon!~
@71   = ~(She then kicks what remains of the corpse in viciously. You cannot help but wince when you hear something crack. With a defiant toss of her head, she looks around at you. For a moment you can see exactly why the Fey'ri should be feared. Rather than fear, there is a savage look of triumphant satisfaction on Fade's face. It is soon replaced by a look of shame when she looks to you)~
@72   = ~Shall... shall we go on now, <CHARNAME>?~
@73   = ~Yes, join up with me again. But I really think we should get some rest straightaway. You need some treatment for those injuries, and possibly a bath.~
@74   = ~Are you insane?! Do you honestly think I'd want someone who could tear up a corpse with her own bare hands in my company? No way, Fade. You're too unstable.~
@75   = ~I would like to have you back, but I fear I have no room in the party for you at the moment. Maybe you could join up with me later?~
@76   = ~Unstable, am I? If you'd been through what they put me through... and here I thought you would at least... I'm not staying here any more! I'll be back at the Shadow Thieves' Guild, where they at least need me!~
@77   = ~(She struggles against you, trying to reach the corpse again, but you are eventually able to drag her away. She does manage one last, savage kick at Mallon's head. You cannot help but wince when you hear something crack. With a defiant toss of her head, she looks around at you. For a moment you can see exactly why the Fey'ri should be feared. Rather than fear, there is a savage look of triumphant satisfaction on Fade's face. It is soon replaced by a look of shame when she looks to you)~
@78   = ~(She nods her head, and suddenly she looks very small and very tired. She does however take your hand in hers and attempts to smile, although it looks more like a grimace)~
@79   = ~Thank you.~
@80   = ~W-what? You come all this way to get me, and then tell me you have no room for me? I... I can't believe it!~
@81   = ~Fair enough, join up with me again. But I really think we should get some rest straightaway. You need some treatment for those injuries.~
@82   = ~I'm sorry, Fade. Maybe you could go back to Aran and get some treatment for those injuries, and if I need you again, I'll come and find you.~
@83   = ~You're... you're abandoning me? Just like this? And here I thought you at least... Fine! I'll go back to the Shadow Thieves! At least they need me!~
@84   = ~(Walking with a pronounced limp, she makes her way to the door. There she stops and turns to you)~
@85   = ~So... you own me now. You bought me from Mallon. What will be your first command, I wonder?~
@86   = ~Fade, I may have bought you, but it was to avoid a fight. I don't consider you my property at all. I'm going to burn the contract.~
@87   = ~Here, the contract. It's yours. You own yourself now.~
@88   = ~Actually, I haven't had any kind of... release for a while now. And there are plenty of beds here... ~
@89   = ~(She shakes her head vehemently, and walking with a pronounced limp, makes her way to the door. There she stops and turns to you)~
@90   = ~(A slow smile spreads its way across her face, re-splitting her lip. She winces, but continues to smile)~
@91   = ~You... you mean I'm free? You've bought me and... freed me? Thank you!~
@92   = ~(hug her) That's okay. I didn't want another fight, and I thought that this way, the Pasha has no legal right to pursue you anymore.~
@93   = ~You're welcome.~
@94   = ~(She looks at the parchment, and then back to you, slightly confused) I... own myself? So, I'm free?~
@95   = ~(A slow, triumphant smile spreads its way across her face, re-splitting her lip. She winces, but continues to smile, and then viciously tears up the contract) I'm free! Thank you!~
@96   = ~You... you dare say that? At a time like this? And here I thought you... you... ~
@97   = ~I hate you.~
@98   = ~(She sharply draws a breath and winces as your arms encircle her waist) Please... don't do that. It hurts.~
@99   = ~Can... can we just go on now, <CHARNAME>?~
@100  = ~So, <CHARNAME>, you grow tired of my company? I had rather hoped not.~
@101  = ~Sorry, Fade, but I must let you go.~
@102  = ~No, on second thought, stay. You're far too useful to lose.~
@103  = ~I'm sorry too. I shall return to the guild then. If you need my services again, I will be with the Shadow Master.~
@104  = ~If I need you, I'll know where to find you.~
@105  = ~No, you can't go back to the guild. Stay here.~
@106  = ~(grin) I knew you couldn't resist my company.~
@107  = ~Y-you wish me to leave? I thought we had something that went beyond being mere travelling companions... ~
@108  = ~Sorry, Fade, but I have decided otherwise. I think you should leave.~
@109  = ~We do. I don't know what I was thinking. Of course, stay at my side.~
@110  = ~Well, then... as you wish, <CHARNAME>. I will return to my guild and the Shadow Master.~
@111  = ~(Fade clasps your hand in hers) Of course... I would never leave you voluntarily, <CHARNAME>. Please remember this.~
@112  = ~So, you come crawling back to me? Finally realised you really *do* need me in your little group?~
@113  = ~Okay, Fade, don't rub it in. Yes, I need you to join me again. What do you want me to do, beg?~
@114  = ~Ahhh... you always did have an odd sense of humour, Fade. So, are you willing to join up with me again?~
@115  = ~I think I've just remembered why I got rid of you in the first place, you sarcastic bitch. So no, I don't need you at all.~
@116  = ~Nope. Just came to see how you were. Fine? Good. Bye!~
@117  = ~(grin) That would be nice... but I'll join you again anyway.~
@118  = ~(laugh) Willing... and very able!~
@119  = ~You dare attack those that help you?! TRAITOR! You will die upon my sword!~
@120  = ~(As you leave the guild, you find yourself pondering your newest travelling companion and cannot help but wonder what her actual motivations for joining you are. She notices your gaze and smiles rather disarmingly at you.)~
@121  = ~Are you sure? If you have something to say, surely it would be better to speak freely than to brood over it... ~
@122  = ~I said no and I mean no... I am grateful for your offer to help me, but that does not mean I trust you. Let us leave it at that.~
@123  = ~I suppose you are right. I just wonder what your true motivations for wanting to help a near-stranger are. Aran says he didn't draft you, and your other explanation hardly sheds any light on why you are really here... how can I trust you?~
@124  = ~Okay... no matter what you say, I think you are a plant, sent by Aran to make sure I don't betray him, and that your other "reasons" are just excuses. I don't trust you, Fade.~
@125  = ~Fair enough. I will say one thing. I must warn you that if I suspect you are running back to Aran to report on me, you're out of this group. I do not know what your true motivations are, but I will not be spied on. Do I make myself clear?~
@126  = ~I understand your suspicion, <CHARNAME>, but please allow me to explain.~
@127  = ~Aran has not "planted" me here. I am charged with the same mission as you, and quite frankly, I have found locating this rival guild difficult. It just made sense to me that we pool our resources.~
@128  = ~(sigh) I also deplore what has happened to your friend. It is a situation I can... sympathise with. I wish Aran had just agreed to help you, but... it is not my place to second-guess the Shadow Master.~
@129  = ~(smile) Come. Hopefully with time I will be able to allay your suspicions. Just know that I am only here to help.~
@130  = ~You can't. I am fully aware that trust is something that must be earned. To be honest with you, I found Aran's tactics of recruiting you to his cause a little unpleasant, but I can see why he did it.~
@131  = ~The rival guild has been very difficult to track. As I said before, Aran charged me with uncovering them, a task I have found increasingly difficult. Now he has charged you with the same goal... it makes sense that we pool our resources.~
@132  = ~(smile) It must have made sense to you too, otherwise I wouldn't be here.~
@133  = ~Yes, I suppose that is true. But I must warn you that if I suspect you are reporting on me, scuttling off to Aran to inform him of my every move, you're out of this company. Do I make myself clear?~
@134  = ~You're dodging the issue... ~
@135  = ~Pooling our resources is one thing, Fade, but why would you want to help me recover Imoen? We are both strangers to you.~
@136  = ~Perfectly. I can understand your suspicion, <CHARNAME>, but I really do want to help you. I'm not here to keep an eye on you for Aran. Believe me, he has enough people capable of doing that already!~
@137  = ~So why then? Why exactly are you here?~
@138  = ~What do you mean by that?~
@139  = ~As long as you are aware of this. If you are straight with me, we'll have no problems.~
@140  = ~Simply because I do wish to help you. Your friend's capture was horrendous... I was there, I saw it. I cannot sit back and let things happen when I am in a situation to help.~
@141  = ~I know it will take time for you to set aside your suspicions about me and I wish... well, let us say I would have preferred to have joined you in different circumstances. But Aran is my Shadow Master, and he wished to be the one to make the offer.~
@142  = ~Come. Let us go. We have much to do.~
@143  = ~Nothing happens here in Athkatla without the Shadow Master knowing something of it. As he said himself, he needed to know what *your* motivation was. You could have proved a serious problem for us... we didn't know either way.~
@144  = ~(smile) But you haven't. You may not believe me, but we are... I am... not about to betray you now. Let us continue on. We have much to do.~
@145  = ~(She holds out her hand) I agree, <CHARNAME>.~
@146  = ~(Eye her suspiciously, but shake her hand)~
@147  = ~(Eye her suspiciously, and do not shake her hand)~
@148  = ~(smile) So we have a deal. Come now, we have much to accomplish.~
@149  = ~(She slowly withdraws her hand with a disappointed look on her face) I see. Well, hopefully in the future I will be able to allay your suspicions, not only about my guild, but also about me.~
@150  = ~All right. I admit that I also wish to help you because I think what has happened to your friend is despicable. If by uncovering our rivals we... I... can help you recover your friend, so much the better.~
@151  = ~(sigh) I do not expect you to trust me immediately, <CHARNAME>, but please at least allow me to help you. Hopefully with time I will be able to allay your suspicions.~
@152  = ~I think what has happened to your friend is abhorrent. Even if you had not been charged with the same mission as I, I would want to help you. I know you must feel that I have been... foisted on you somewhat, and I do regret that. Hopefully in the future your suspicions about me will be allayed.~
@153  = ~(smile) Come now, we have much to do.~
@154  = ~I can only try to assure you that this is not the case, but you are entitled to your opinion. I was simply charged with the same mission as you, and quite frankly, I have found unearthing information about this rival guild quite difficult. It just made sense to me that we pool our resources.~
@155  = ~(sigh) I also abhor what has happened to your friend. It is a situation I can... sympathise with. I wish Aran had just agreed to help you, but... it is not my place to second-guess the Shadow Master.~
@156  = ~Is there anything you wish, <CHARNAME>?~
@157  = ~No... nothing.~
@158  = ~Yes, there is actually. I was just wondering what your real reasons are for joining up with me. You say Aran didn't draft you... but how can I trust either of you?~
@159  = ~No... other than to warn you that if I suspect you are running back to your master to report on me, you're out of this group. Do I make myself clear?~
@160  = ~Can I have a look at that, <CHARNAME>?~
@161  = ~Sure. (toss the Mantle of Waukeen over to her)~
@162  = ~No, I'd better get it back.~
@163  = ~Do you honestly think I'm going to hand this over to you, thief? No, I don't think so.~
@164  = ~Thanks. (she takes the collar and wanders off to a secluded corner, her back turned to you)~
@165  = ~(Leave her to it)~
@166  = ~Fade, what are you doing? (go over to her)~
@167  = ~(Go over and snatch the collar back from her) I've changed my mind. I'll take that back, thank you!~
@168  = ~(She continues to "examine" the collar. At least, that's what you think she's doing. After a couple of minutes, she turns and hands the collar back to you.)~
@169  = ~Exquisite piece... (grin)~
@170  = ~(Look at the collar) You've jemmied some of the jewels off! Fade, you can't do that! Hand them over, now.~
@171  = ~(Look at the collar. You can see that some of the gems that stud the collar are missing, but you can't be sure if they weren't missing before you handed the collar to her) Fade, did you take some of the gems from this collar?~
@172  = ~(grin) Yes, it is. Now hide the gems you took somewhere safe and if anyone mentions it, we'll say it was like that when we found it.~
@173  = ~(smile) Thank you. (put the collar in your pack without looking at it)~
@174  = ~(pout) I didn't! I was... umm... ~
@175  = ~(She sighs angrily, shrugs and hands over the gems) No one would have known... ~
@176  = ~That's not the point! We were asked to retrieve it, not take what we want before handing it over!~
@177  = ~True... Still, we can't... can we?~
@178  = ~I can't believe you even considered that! Now hand over the jewels, and we'll see if we can put them back. Hopefully no one will realise... ~
@179  = ~(She sighs angrily, but hands the gems over) Happy now?~
@180  = ~(smile) Of course we can. No one would know. Just think of the money... ~
@181  = ~Money? Is that everything to you? No, hand the gems over, they're going back in the collar.~
@182  = ~Yes, the money... they wouldn't notice. Okay... ~
@183  = ~Good <PRO_GIRLBOY>. (She winks and drops the gems into her cleavage) For safe keeping... ~
@184  = ~For safe keeping? Fair enough.~
@185  = ~For safe keeping? Well, I shall look forward to... retrieving them from you later, then.~
@186  = ~(She gives you a slightly sly look) Tut tut, <CHARNAME>. (She looks thoughtful and then grins) Well, we'll see... ~
@187  = ~(She winks as she saunters past you)~
@188  = ~(pout) I wasn't! I was... umm... ~
@189  = ~No one would have noticed anyway... ~
@190  = ~(grin) No, no one would notice... how long has this thing been here anyway? Quick, hide them somewhere safe, and if anyone notices, we'll say it was like that when we found it.~
@191  = ~(She winks and puts the gems in her cleavage) For safe keeping... ~
@192  = ~(She glances at you over her shoulder) Nothing.~
@193  = ~(Look over her shoulder) Fade, are you trying to jemmy the jewels out of that collar? You can't do that! That's not right! (snatch the collar back from her)~
@194  = ~(Look over her shoulder) Fade, I do believe you are trying to pry the gems from that collar. (raise an eyebrow)~
@195  = ~Okay, then, give it back when you've finished looking at it.~
@196  = ~Me? Do a thing like that? Perish the thought! (grin)~
@197  = ~(grin) Sure you wouldn't... Now hide them somewhere safe, and if anyone asks we'll say it was like that when we found it.~
@198  = ~Not this time, Fade. Come on, hand them over.~
@199  = ~(smile) Oh, come on now. Can't I... change your mind? (she runs a finger along your jaw line. Her touch is light and sends tingles down your spine)~
@200  = ~(Grab her finger) No, I'm serious. Hand them over now.~
@201  = ~Well... okay. If you're sure... ~
@202  = ~(Put an arm around her waist) Change my mind? Well, that depends on what you mean by that.~
@203  = ~(She rolls her eyes, grins, and then pulls away from you) One-track mind, eh, <CHARNAME>?~
@204  = ~(She winks and drops the gems into her cleavage) For safe keeping... ~
@205  = ~(She growls and pouts) I was only having a look!~
@206  = ~Oh, yes, I suppose you're right... ~
@207  = ~There's no need to be so rude! (she storms off, muttering under her breath)~
@208  = ~(As you enter the temple, you hear a long indrawn breath from Fade. Her eyes are like saucers and there is a hungry expression on her face) Ohhhhhh... shiny things... ~
@209  = ~(chuckle to yourself and leave her be--you know that Fade has about as much restraint around wealth as a magpie has for things that sparkle)~
@210  = ~(whisper) Fade, I'm warning you... you're to keep your hands to yourself here. The last thing I need is to gain disfavour with the temple.~
@211  = ~(She continues to look around at the temple, and her eyes rest on a collection plate laden with gold and jewels. You're not sure if she's ignoring you, or if she really is so distracted she didn't hear you)~
@212  = ~(She grins and flexes her fingers.) Sparkle sparkle... ~
@213  = ~(snap your fingers in front of her face) Fade! I said no.~
@214  = ~(loudly) Gosh, look how full that collection plate is! If I were you, I'd put it away before someone thinks of stealing from it.~
@215  = ~(As you snap your fingers, she jumps, as if she was unaware of your presence. She licks her lips and looks longingly towards the plate) Oh, come now, <CHARNAME>. They wouldn't miss some of those baubles. I could have them away in seconds. No one would ever know.~
@216  = ~I said no and I mean no. Come here, give me your hand. I'm going to keep a tight hold on you. Now behave yourself!~
@217  = ~I know, I know. Normally I wouldn't be bothered. But we may need the help of this temple in the future--you never know. Now are you going to behave yourself, or am I going to have to hold your hand?~
@218  = ~(A guard looks your way, makes his way over to the collection plate, nods to you and stands in front of it. You hear Fade hiss behind you, and when you turn to regard her, she looks furious) <CHARNAME>! Now you've alerted them! How could you! The value of gems in that plate alone... ~
@219  = ~We may need the help of this temple in the future, the last thing *I* need is a bunch of angry Morning Knights after me because you can't control yourself!~
@220  = ~It doesn't matter how much those gems are worth! Normally I wouldn't be bothered, but I really don't want to upset this lot, especially when we may need their help in the future. Now are you going to behave yourself?~
@221  = ~(She looks down at your interlaced fingers, and you swear you see an almost sly half-smile creep across her lips.) I don't know, <CHARNAME>. I've still got another hand... ~
@222  = ~I am being serious! I swear, if you nick anything here, I'm going to... going to... well, I don't know exactly what I'll do to you, but it won't be pleasant!~
@223  = ~(grab her other hand) You want me to hold that one too? Fade, please just do as you're told. I can't keep both your hands occupied and talk to people at the same time!~
@224  = ~(She says nothing, but rolls her eyes at you and holds her hand out to you, obviously expecting you to take it. As you interlace your fingers with hers, you swear you see an almost sly half-smile creep across her lips.) I don't know if that'll be enough to stop me, <CHARNAME>. I've still got another hand... ~
@225  = ~(She purses her lips and gives you an almost sulky look) Okay, I understand. I'll be a good girl... this time.~
@226  = ~(sulkily) Yes, <CHARNAME>. (mutter) You can be a real kill-joy when you want to... but I'll do as you say.~
@227  = ~(This time, there is no mistaking the huge and slightly lascivious grin that spreads across her face.) Won't it, <CHARNAME>? How can you be so sure? Maybe I should take something, just to see what you'll do... ~
@228  = ~(She holds your gaze for a trifle longer than necessary, and then sighs) Okay, I give in. I'll be a good girl. In here, at least.~
@229  = ~(This time, there is no mistaking the huge and slightly lascivious grin that spreads across her face) Oh, I don't know. I can think of a few things that would most definitely keep both my hands busy... ~
@230  = ~(She holds your gaze for a trifle longer than necessary, still grinning)~
@231  = ~Fade!~
@232  = ~Well... maybe later, but not now.~
@233  = ~What?! I was going to suggest writing or making little origami animals!~
@234  = ~(She grins again, then sighs) Okay, I give in. I'll be a good girl. In here, at least.~
@235  = ~Oh, so you're interested in origami too, then?~
@236  = ~(shudder) Do we really have to be down here? Are you sure there isn't another way?~
@237  = ~What's wrong? You aren't afraid of the dark, are you?~
@238  = ~I know it isn't very nice down here, but you heard the cleric. If we are to sort out this cult business, we have to investigate. Sorry.~
@239  = ~Please, stop your whining. We're all in the same boat, and I don't hear the others complaining.~
@240  = ~Afraid of the *dark*? Just in case you hadn't realized, I'm a sneak, <CHARNAME>! That means I normally work under the cover of darkness!~
@241  = ~So, what is it then? Confined spaces? Dirt? What?~
@242  = ~Well, if that is the case, stop whining. We're all in the same boat, and I don't hear the others complaining.~
@243  = ~Okay, okay, point taken. Just as long as you're all right--I don't need you to be freaking out on me.~
@244  = ~I know... doesn't mean I have to like it down here.~
@245  = ~Did you... did you hear that? That scrabbling noise? No no no... please, <CHARNAME>, let's get out of here.~
@246  = ~What's wrong? What are you worried about? Are you afraid of the dark?~
@247  = ~I don't think it's anything to worry about. Probably just rats.~
@248  = ~I'm not whining! It just isn't very nice down here, that's all. In future I'll keep my observations to myself!~
@249  = ~No, confined spaces and dirt don't bother me. I just don't like... oh gods, I feel so stupid telling you this... I don't like rats very much. In fact, they totally creep me out. Looking all wet even when they're not, with their long wormy tails... (shudder) They're horrible!~
@250  = ~You're afraid of rats?! Come now, you expect me to believe that? I've never heard the like. A rogue scared of rats! Nonsense!~
@251  = ~Yeah, I do know where you're coming from. They are pretty nasty, aren't they? Still, they're better than spiders.~
@252  = ~(sigh) Oh, for the love of... all this because of some bloody rodents? They aren't going to hurt you! Just ignore them and they'll ignore you.~
@253  = ~(stiffly) I'm okay, <CHARNAME>. I won't let you down.~
@254  = ~Rats? Are you serious? Ooooh, <CHARNAME>, I... I don't like rats very much. In fact, I don't like them at all! Looking all wet even when they're not, with their long wormy tails... (shudder) They're horrible!~
@255  = ~It's *not* nonsense! Some of them are the size of badgers, and they go straight for your throat! They crawl around your feet, looking to trip up unwary folk so they can drag them down into the depths and feast on their eyes, and...~
@256  = ~Fade, stop talking silly! Dire rats, yes, they could be a problem, but common sewer rats? They are more afraid of us then we are of them!~
@257  = ~(snigger) Size of badgers, eh? And feasting on eyes no less. You'd better watch your back if I were you!~
@258  = ~I'm not too fond of spiders either, to be honest. Tell you what, though--I'll deal with the spiders if you deal with the rats. I think that's a fair deal!~
@259  = ~Oh yes, "just ignore them" <PRO_HESHE> says; "they won't hurt you"... shows what you know! Nasty bloody verminous things that they are! (shudder)~
@260  = ~Well? What are you waiting for, oh fearless leader? Once more into the bloody breach and all that...~
@261  = ~Oh, *please* don't mention dire rats! They are like the ultimate in ratty horror! Rats with armour and huge great big pointy teef like iff! (She holds her fingers up to her mouth in a rather comedic parody of dire rat dentition)~
@262  = ~You wait until they come at you at head height--then we'll see who's right!~
@263  = ~Oh, bugger off and take the mickey out of someone else, <CHARNAME>. Just you wait until they come at you at head height--then we'll see who's right!~
@264  = ~That man is the most arrogant bastard I have ever met!~
@265  = ~Oh, I don't know. He seemed nice enough to me.~
@266  = ~Tell me about it! Ordering me around like a lackey... ~
@267  = ~Why doesn't he like you?~
@268  = ~Nice? I hope you're being sarcastic, <CHARNAME>.~
@269  = ~No, I wasn't. I thought he was perfectly pleasant. Why don't you like him?~
@270  = ~(grin) Of course I was! Who does he think he is, ordering me about like that?~
@271  = ~He's like that with everyone. Just because he has a bit of power, he feels he can command whoever he pleases!~
@272  = ~So why doesn't he like you?~
@273  = ~Well, there's no use complaining. I've agreed to do the mission now. We'd better get on with it.~
@274  = ~When I first arrived in Athkatla, I lived rough, and supplemented my meager income by doing a bit of freelance thieving. Renal... err... caught me. Ever since then, I haven't been his favourite person. He thinks Aran was... misguided in employing me.~
@275  = ~(sigh) So if I'm involved in anything, no matter how small my role, if it goes wrong, it's invariably my fault. Renal wants me out, but won't tackle Aran directly about it. And as much as I hate to admit it, Renal *is* my superior. Aran has told me in no uncertain terms that I'm not to cheek him anymore, or I will be out on my ear.~
@276  = ~Come on, we'd better do as he asks before I get into trouble again.~
@277  = ~True. If we don't, I'll only get into trouble again. Renal delights in blaming me for everything as it is.~
@278  = ~I don't know whether I should be here, <CHARNAME>.~
@279  = ~You'll be fine. Just keep the cowl of your hood up, and no one will take any notice.~
@280  = ~Maybe you should wait outside.~
@281  = ~As long as you're sure... and as long as you realise that Renal *will* kill me if this gets screwed up because Mae'Var recognizes me.~
@282  = ~Is there a good chance of that? Of Mae'Var recognizing you?~
@283  = ~If that's the case, maybe you should wait outside.~
@284  = ~But that isn't going to happen, is it? Because you're going to keep your head down and let me do the talking, aren't you?~
@285  = ~I could... but what if it kicks off in there? What use to you am I outside? No, I'll be okay. I'll just keep my head down and try to live up to my namesake. (grin)~
@286  = ~I don't know... I've never had any dealings with him. I've heard rumour that he's a pretty nasty piece of work, but is only interested in himself. Do as he says, and he'll probably ignore us for the best part... hopefully. I'll just keep my head down and try to live up to my namesake. (grin)~
@287  = ~(Fade grins and mock-salutes you) Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! I'll hover around the back and try to live up to my namesake. But if it does go pear-shaped, let me take the rap. I know how to deal with Renal.~
@288  = ~Oh, no... I don't like being in here at all. Too many of my friends have been caught and danced the hemp fandango on the orders of people here.~
@289  = ~<CHARNAME>, a moment, please? I have something for you.~
@290  = ~Here. This amulet I've been wearing. I want you to have it, to protect you from the vampires.~
@291  = ~You want me to have your necklace? But don't you need it?~
@292  = ~Thank you very much, Fade. I really appreciate it.~
@293  = ~No, Fade, I can't. It was given to you to protect *you* from the vampires. I can't take it from you.~
@294  = ~Are you saying you don't think I can handle the vampires?~
@295  = ~I'll be fine. I... I just want you to have it. You're Imoen's last chance, and if you get injured or... or killed, she's done for.~
@296  = ~Then I thank you for being so thoughtful.~
@297  = ~Still, it was given to you to protect you from the vampires. I can't take it from you.~
@298  = ~I think I can handle the vampires okay, Fade. Are you saying you don't think I can?~
@299  = ~Think nothing of it. I just don't want to see you get hurt.~
@300  = ~Please--just take it. I'll be fine. I really don't think I could stand to see you get hurt. This way I know you'll be safer.~
@301  = ~(She takes your hand and forces you to take the amulet) You've been so good to me, I feel this is the least I can do for you.~
@302  = ~Of course not! I just know that this will give you an added bit of protection.~
@303  = ~<CHARNAME>, my love... a moment, please? I have something for you.~
@304  = ~You want me to have your necklace? My sweet, don't you need it?~
@305  = ~(She kisses your cheek) I'll be fine. I want you to have it. You're Imoen's last chance, and if you get injured or... or killed, she's done for.~
@306  = ~I know you're not going to take "no" for an answer... and I thank you for your thoughtfulness.~
@307  = ~Still, it was given to you to protect you from the vampires. I can't take it from you--I couldn't stand to see you hurt!~
@308  = ~Think nothing of it. I just couldn't stand to see you get hurt.~
@309  = ~(She takes your hand and forces you to take the amulet) Take it, like you took my heart.~
@310  = ~Of course not! I just know that this will give you an added bit of protection. I know I couldn't stand to see you hurt in any way.~
@311  = ~<CHARNAME>, I promise you--the vampire speaks only lies. We wouldn't betray you now.~
@312  = ~<CHARNAME>, I promise you--the vampire speaks only lies. We wouldn't betray you now. I wouldn't let it happen.~
@313  = ~Well... we've arrived. How are you feeling?~
@314  = ~Feeling? What do you mean?~
@315  = ~Nervous. Now we're here, I'm so close to my goal... I just hope Imoen is okay.~
@316  = ~Bloody awful. I hate boats.~
@317  = ~Good. I can at last give Irenicus what is coming to him. And those Cowled Wizards as well.~
@318  = ~You're so close to your goal now... Imoen isn't far away. And neither is Irenicus.~
@319  = ~I know. I just hope Imoen is okay.~
@320  = ~I know. At last I'll be able to give Irenicus what is coming to him. And those Cowled Wizards too.~
@321  = ~I know. I'll just be glad when all this is over.~
@322  = ~I'm sure she's fine.~
@323  = ~I seriously hope you're right.~
@324  = ~I'm not so sure. I keep having these... dreams. She's in them, and everything is *not* fine.~
@325  = ~Well, we'll see. If anything has happened to her, I'm going to make Irenicus pay. And those Cowled Wizards too.~
@326  = ~I know you do. But we're back on dry land now, and you're nearing your goal. Imoen isn't far away... and neither is Irenicus.~
@327  = ~Please, <CHARNAME>... you can't take on the Cowled Wizards. I know what they have done to Imoen is awful, but you won't be doing her any favours by getting yourself killed. Irenicus is locked up--just leave him there. Get Imoen and just... go.~
@328  = ~"Get Imoen and just go"? Are you mad? I haven't come all this way just to rescue her! That mage owes me some answers, and I owe him a debt of pain!~
@329  = ~As much as it galls me to admit it, you're right. I'm here for Imoen--she must be my first priority.~
@330  = ~Fade, shut up. We do things my way--end of story. Is that clear?~
@331  = ~I think that we all will be. Then we can just get back to normal.~
@332  = ~(She smiles, but it has an odd, almost sad edge to it)~
@333  = ~Fade, you don't seem too pleased about that prospect.~
@334  = ~I agree. Now let's just get on with it.~
@335  = ~(She smiles and kisses you on the cheek)~
@336  = ~(sigh) You're right. Let's just get on with it.~
@337  = ~(sigh) So do I. But, no matter what, you have done everything in your power to rescue her. You must always remember that.~
@338  = ~Dreams? What kind of dreams?~
@339  = ~Oh, nothing. Forget I mentioned them. Let's just get on with what we have to do.~
@340  = ~Strange dreams. Imoen is in them, and Irenicus. He... shows me things. Powers. What I could be. I think he's referring to my taint. But they invariably end with Imoen being hurt. They are so vivid.~
@341  = ~They are dreams of power. Of what I could be. They're... exciting, in some ways.~
@342  = ~I know you feel strongly about this, <CHARNAME>, and believe me, I understand your feeling totally, but your death will surely mean Imoen's too. Let the wizards deal with Irenicus!~
@343  = ~Don't you dare tell me what to do! It is *my* decision how I deal with this. Just leave me be.~
@344  = ~I hadn't thought of it like that. You're right. I am here for Imoen. She is my first priority.~
@345  = ~(sigh) You know, <CHARNAME>, if we were in any other circumstances... but I understand how you must be feeling right now. All right then. Let's just get on with it.~
@346  = ~Not that it will be easy, of course, but we're all here for you, to the bitter end. And I'm rather looking forward to meeting Imoen, too.~
@347  = ~I know you're under a lot of pressure, <CHARNAME>, but there's no need to be rude. All right then. Let's just get on with it.~
@348  = ~What ever do you mean? Of course I'll be happy when all of this is over!~
@349  = ~(She blushes slightly and hurries away from you)~
@350  = ~Hmmm. Most dreams are just nonsense, but I would probably pay attention to those ones. Considering what you are... ~
@351  = ~(She looks worried for a fleeting moment, but then looks directly at you and smiles a little too brightly) But I'm sure Imoen is fine. Let's just get prepared and go get her.~
@352  = ~Exciting? Well, I suppose if you're being shown images of a more powerful self, they would be. Just don't lose sight of your goal here, <CHARNAME>--your friend and sister, Imoen.~
@353  = ~So, the drow bitch managed to seduce you, did she?~
@354  = ~I... I don't know what you are talking about, Fade.~
@355  = ~Fade, please, I had no choice. I didn't want to.~
@356  = ~Fade, I'm sorry, but I will do what I have to in order to get us out of here alive. And if that involves acting like a proper drow male, so be it!~
@357  = ~What if she did? What does it have to do with you?~
@358  = ~Oh, please, don't play dumb with me, <CHARNAME>. I know exactly what went on in there, I'm not stupid!~
@359  = ~Please, I'd rather not talk about it, okay? It's not like I had a choice in the matter.~
@360  = ~What does it matter to you? What I get up to is no concern of yours. Why are you so upset by it?~
@361  = ~What else was I supposed to do? I'm a drow male here, Fade, and males do as they are told! If this helps us get out of here alive, then so be it.~
@362  = ~Well, *part* of you must have wanted to.~
@363  = ~Please, don't be like that. The last thing I need is for you to turn on me.~
@364  = ~Why are you so upset? What I get up to is no concern of yours.~
@365  = ~It wasn't easy, Fade, but males are subservient here, and if I have to act like a proper drow male to get us out of here in one piece, I will. I just hope you understand that.~
@366  = ~You could have made up an excuse! Anything would have done!~
@367  = ~Fade, I don't understand why this is bothering you so much! I did what I had to.~
@368  = ~I know this place makes you twitchy, Fade, but this is ridiculous. I did what I had to, I took no pleasure from it. Please try to understand, I did this to get us all out of here alive!~
@369  = ~Please, don't be like this! The last thing I need is for you to turn against me over it.~
@370  = ~Males are subservient here, Fade! Refusing a female is probably punishable by death, or something! Please try to understand.~
@371  = ~I... just expected better from you, <CHARNAME>. I didn't think you the type to... do such a thing. Obviously I was wrong!~
@372  = ~Don't make it sound like it was easy, Fade, because it wasn't! Males are subservient here, and if I have to act like a proper drow male to get us out of here in one piece, I will. I just hope you understand that.~
@373  = ~I... I wouldn't do that, <CHARNAME>. (sigh) Whether I like it or not, the deed has been done. Let's just work on getting out of here. (shiver) I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@374  = ~(sigh) I suppose you are right. This place does affect me adversely. And whether I like it or not, the deed has been done. Let's just put all of our energy into getting out of here.~
@375  = ~(She closes her eyes and nods) I'll try. (sigh) Whether I like it or not, the deed has been done. Let's just work on getting out of here. (shiver) I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@376  = ~Yes you do! You jumped into bed with that darkling harpy at the first opportunity! Did I even cross your mind, or were you too busy sating yourself within her?~
@377  = ~No! It wasn't like that at all! I didn't want to do it, but I had no choice!~
@378  = ~I knew you'd react like this. You don't own me, Fade! I can do what I want!~
@379  = ~Well, *part* of you must have wanted to! There is *always* a choice, <CHARNAME>!~
@380  = ~Always a choice, Fade? How does that apply to you then? You're so quick to say *you* never had a choice. How does that make our situations any different?~
@381  = ~Fade, please, I did what I had to! I look no pleasure from it. I thought of you the whole time, and how that one, despicable act might get you out of here alive!~
@382  = ~I thought you wanted me! But obviously I was wrong. Well, this is me doing what *I* want! We are *history*, <CHARNAME>!~
@383  = ~I... I wouldn't do that, <CHARNAME>. I just can't stand the thought of you with that bitch! I do understand why you did it, but I don't have to like it. (shiver) Let's just concentrate on getting out of here. I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@384  = ~You evil-minded bastard! How *dare* you say such a thing! You know my situation was totally different from this one! I... I can't even believe you would say such a thing!~
@385  = ~Fade, I shouldn't have said that. This situation is totally different from yours. I'm sorry.~
@386  = ~I'm sorry, but I can't see any difference in our situations, Fade. I did what I had to, just as you once did! Just please believe me, I look no pleasure from it. I thought of you the whole time, and how that one, despicable act might get you out of here alive.~
@387  = ~You don't like it when the boot is on the other foot, do you? I did what I had to, and if you don't like it, then that's your problem, not mine.~
@388  = ~Fade, please, I didn't mean it like that! It's just that males are subservient here. Refusing a female is probably punishable by death, or something! Please try to understand.~
@389  = ~And whether I like it or not, the deed has been done. I just can't stand the thought of you with that bitch! (shiver) Let's just concentrate on getting out of here. I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@390  = ~(She closes her eyes and nods) I'll try to. (sigh) Whether I like it or not, the deed has been done. I just can't stand the thought of you with that bitch! Let's... let's just work on getting out of here. (shiver) I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@391  = ~No, I'm sorry too. This place is affecting me badly, and whether I like it or not, the deed has been done. I just can't stand the thought of you with that bitch! Let's... let's just work on getting out of here. (shiver) I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@392  = ~My problem? Not anymore. We're through, <CHARNAME>... for good.~
@393  = ~You... weren't in there very long. I was sure she had, well, plans for the two of you.~
@394  = ~She did. But there's no way I was going to give in to her.~
@395  = ~Yes, and she was a little disappointed that I turned her down. I think it may be prudent for us to find our way out of here as soon as possible.~
@396  = ~I couldn't do it, Fade. Not when--~
@397  = ~(smile) Well, I for one am glad to hear you say that. I... I really don't like the thought of the two of you together. Come on, let's just concentrate on getting out of here. I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@398  = ~Agreed! (smile) I'm really glad you turned her down. I really wouldn't like to think of the two of you together like that. Let's just concentrate on getting out of here. I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@399  = ~When... what?~
@400  = ~Oh, nothing. Come on, we have much to do.~
@401  = ~When I can only think of another.~
@402  = ~(smile) I see. I'm really glad you turned her down, <CHARNAME>. I really wouldn't like to think of the two of you together like that. Let's just concentrate on getting out of here. (shiver) I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@403  = ~Truly? Then I am even happier that you turned her down, <CHARNAME>. It shows not only that you respect yourself, but that you really care about... this person. Come on, let's concentrate on getting out of here. (shiver) I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@404  = ~<CHARNAME>... you weren't in there very long. I was sure she had... plans for the two of you.~
@405  = ~She did. But there was no way I was going to betray you, Fade, not even to get us out of here. I just couldn't.~
@406  = ~I love you too much to do something like that to you, Fade.~
@407  = ~I resisted her charms fine, Fade. Do you think so little of me?~
@408  = ~And I am glad to hear that... I really am. Come on, my love, let us concentrate on getting out of here. (shiver) I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@409  = ~No, of course I don't! I am just relieved you were able to refuse her and walk out of there alive--other drow males would not be so fortunate. I was so worried she would... force you to be with her.~
@410  = ~(smile) But she didn't. Come on, my love, let us concentrate on getting out of here. (shiver) I hate this place more with every second that passes.~
@411  = ~Just to warn you, Aran's mother is quite... elderly, and has some funny views. Just smile and nod and you'll be fine. And if she offers you cake, take it but don't eat it. It's probably 20 years old.~
@412  = ~Well, I don't think that went too badly, everything considered. At least she didn't chase me out of the house with a poker this time.~
@413  = ~Bloody nature... why is it so full of things that have prickles and bits that sting? GET... OFF... ME! Oh, for the love of--ouch! Damn thing has spines the size of dragon's teeth! Oh, so you're not going to let go? RIGHT! No more Mr. Nice Guy... it's time to get Thayvian on your sorry leafy arse!~
@414  = ~Fade? You okay back there?~
@415  = ~(grin and leave her to it)~
@416  = ~No! I *hate* nature! Horrible nasty, vindictive bitch-queen that she is... can we go home now? Please?~
@417  = ~No, no, NO!! Let go! My sword! Nasty sodding little... Eeeek! A spider! (whimper) <CHARNAME>, I want to go home now! HATE nature! HATE her! Horrible nasty, vindictive bitch-queen that she is... ~
@418  = ~(grimace) Nice place they've got here.~
@419  = ~Oh, great... nutters. Just what we need. Well, come on, <CHARNAME>. Let's find Imoen and get out of here as soon as possible. This place really gives me the creeps.~
@420  = ~That's... Imoen? Oh, <CHARNAME>... I am sorry. I'm sure we'll be able to find some way to help her.~
@421  = ~Wh-what happened there, <CHARNAME>? Are you okay? You look a bit... drained.~
@422  = ~I... I don't know what happened, Fade. I think Irenicus took something from me.~
@423  = ~That complete bastard took my soul, that's what he did!~
@424  = ~Fade, I'm sorry, but I don't really have the time to discuss this right now. We have to get out of here and get Irenicus!~
@425  = ~He... took something? Like what?~
@426  = ~I... I think he took my soul. Fade, what am I going to do?~
@427  = ~He took my soul, for some reason.~
@428  = ~It doesn't matter. I'm sorry, but I don't really have the time to discuss this right now. We have to get out of here and get Irenicus!~
@429  = ~Your *soul*? How... how did he do that? Oh, <CHARNAME>, this can't be happening!~
@430  = ~Well, it is happening. And now I have to find him as soon as I can. I hope I can rely on you to help me.~
@431  = ~He took it during some kind of magical ritual--I don't exactly know what it was. I had some kind of dream... Imoen was in it. Apart from that, I don't know.~
@432  = ~Fade, we don't have time to discuss this now. We have to get out of here and get Irenicus!~
@433  = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. I understand.~
@434  = ~(To your surprise, she gives you a quick hug) Just... if you need anything, or you... feel anything, please, let me know. If I can help you in any way, I shall.~
@435  = ~You... we... are going to get it back from Irenicus--right now! How dare he do this to you!~
@436  = ~He took your *soul*? That's really serious! How... how did he do that? Oh, <CHARNAME>, this can't be happening!~
@437  = ~(To your surprise, she gives you a quick hug) Of course you can rely on me. I'll be here for you, for any reason, for any reason at all. If I can help you in any way, I shall.~
@438  = ~Imoen was in it? What does Imoen have to do with it all?~
@439  = ~Fade, it doesn't matter. We don't have time to discuss this now. We have to get out of here and get Irenicus!~
@440  = ~You know I've always referred to her as my sister? Well, it turns out she *is* my sister--she's a Bhaalspawn too. Don't ask me why she was in my... vision. She just was.~
@441  = ~Imoen is a Bhaalspawn? Well, I suppose that explains a lot.~
@442  = ~Wh-what happened there, <CHARNAME>? Are you okay? I was so worried... ~
@443  = ~I'm okay, Fade, but I... I don't know what happened. I think Irenicus took something from me.~
@444  = ~It really doesn't matter. I don't want to worry you unnecessarily.~
@445  = ~Well, it is happening. And now I have to find him as soon as I can. I really need to be sure I can rely on you, Fade.~
@446  = ~(She holds you closer and kisses you on the forehead) Just... if you need anything, or you... feel anything, please, let me know. If I can help you in any way, I shall.~
@447  = ~Now I really am worried! <CHARNAME>, my love... please tell me... ~
@448  = ~Okay. I... I think he took my soul. Fade. What am I going to do?~
@449  = ~Please, try not to be too concerned, but... he took my soul, for some reason.~
@450  = ~(She holds you closer and kisses you on the forehead) Of course you can rely on me. I'll be here for you, for any reason--for any reason at all. If I can help you in any way, I shall.~
@451  = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. I understand. Just... if you need anything, or you... feel anything, please, let me know. If I can help you in any way, I shall.~
@452  = ~You... we... are going to get it back from Irenicus--right now! How dare he do this to you! If you need anything, or you... feel anything, please, let me know. If I can help you in any way, I shall.~
@453  = ~Of course you can rely on me. I'll be here for you, for any reason--any reason at all. If I can help you in any way, I shall.~
@454  = ~Imoen is a Bhaalspawn? Well, I suppose that explains a lot. If you need anything, or you... feel anything, please, let me know. If I can help you in any way, I shall.~
@455  = ~<CHARNAME>... do you know what happened there? You changed into the avatar of Bhaal, the Slayer!~
@456  = ~I... I did? I felt something happen... I just wanted to kill everyone. I was possessed with amazing strength, and... and... what the hell is happening to me?!~
@457  = ~I know. Fade... please... I need you close to me now.~
@458  = ~How do you know what I changed into?~
@459  = ~I know. That felt... strange. So much power, all within me!~
@460  = ~(She backs away from you, eyeing you warily) I... I don't know. Whatever Irenicus did to you... ~
@461  = ~Fade, why are you backing away from me? I won't hurt you.~
@462  = ~You have every right to be wary--I've never lost control like that before! But I swear it won't happen again.~
@463  = ~Fade... please don't... I need you now more than ever!~
@464  = ~(She backs away from you, eyeing you warily) <CHARNAME>... ~
@465  = ~The Fey'ri may not worship any particular deity, but they know who the Lord of Murder was. We are all familiar with his precepts and his... different forms.~
@466  = ~(She backs away from you, eyeing you warily) <CHARNAME>... this is more serious than I thought.~
@467  = ~Please... don't say you *liked* that!~
@468  = ~I... don't know. It did feel good, but seeing your reaction, I know I don't want it to ever happen again!~
@469  = ~You have no idea. It felt so good... like I could take on the world!~
@470  = ~(She takes a deep breath and then steps forward, wrapping her arms around you) Of course you wouldn't. But we will need to take precautions, just in case. I won't pretend that the thought of you as the Slayer doesn't frighten me, because it does... but we'll get through this together. That I promise you.~
@471  = ~I don't think you are going to have much of a choice in this, <CHARNAME>.~
@472  = ~(She takes a deep breath and then steps forward, wrapping her arms around you) But I won't let it affect our relationship. I won't pretend that the thought of you as the Slayer doesn't frighten me, because it does... but we'll get through this together. That I promise you.~
@473  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... I wish I could make all of this stop for you, but I can't!~
@474  = ~(She takes a deep breath and then steps forward, wrapping her arms around you) I won't pretend that the thought of you as the Slayer doesn't frighten me, because it does... but we'll get through this together. That I promise you.~
@475  = ~<CHARNAME>... I wish I could end this entire situation for you, but I can't!~
@476  = ~(She backs away from you) <CHARNAME>, you're scaring me. Please, stop it!~
@477  = ~But don't you realise what this means? I can use the Slayer to defeat Irenicus!~
@478  = ~Maybe not, but do you honestly think you can control the Slayer, totally? <CHARNAME>... I love you, but this really scares me! Please, for our sake, try to fight the urge.~
@479  = ~Alright. For you, I will fight the urge.~
@480  = ~No! This is more than just you and me... this is what I was born to be! And I will not let you stand in my way!~
@481  = ~But you can't control the Slayer! You could have used it to destroy Bodhi, but you didn't--you turned on your friends... you turned on me! Please, <CHARNAME>... I love you, but this really scares me! Please, for our sake, try to fight the urge.~
@482  = ~(She takes a deep breath and then steps forward, wrapping her arms around you) Thank you... that is all I ask.~
@483  = ~Then what we have is *over* <CHARNAME>! I... I can't be with someone who would willingly turn into an eight-foot murderous monster just to get his own way! I'm sorry!~
@484  = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, you did say we would go and see what the Shadow Master wanted! He will not be pleased that we are taking so long.~
@485  = ~<CHARNAME>... I'm sorry, but I really have to go back to the Stronghold. We are only going to anger the Shadow Master in taking this long. Follow me if you want to.~
@486  = ~(Fade looks very distracted)~
@487  = ~Fade, are you alright?~
@488  = ~By that look, I take it you think you know who this is?~
@489  = ~Yes, I'm fine. I just hope I'm wrong, that's all.~
@490  = ~I think I do... and I hope I'm wrong. We'll see.~
@491  = ~(She stands over the body of her brother, and in one last defiant gesture, plunges her dagger deeply into his chest)  No, dear brother... the "bonus" is all mine.~
@492  = ~Fade, come away now. Let us leave and report to Aran.~
@493  = ~Err... this whole corpse mutilation thing you have when you kill your sworn enemies? It's just a bit scary, that's all. Well, a bit more that just a *bit* scary, actually. Let's just leave him and go and tell Aran, shall we?~
@494  = ~Let's not go to Aran just yet. I don't think this is over, <CHARNAME>. He said "we". There are more Fey'ri in Athkatla, and they are looking for something. And there's a good chance that Cirion is with them... I owe that bastard a debt of pain.~
@495  = ~Even so, as Xek'ral said, this has nothing to do with you. You've found out the Fey'ri are here, let Aran deal with them!~
@496  = ~Revenge will get you nowhere, Fade! Leave Cirion--he's in the past now.~
@497  = ~I agree. We must find Cirion and the other Fey'ri before they can do any real damage... and punish them for what they did to you.~
@498  = ~I... I can't help it. After all this bastard put me through... and we can't go to Aran, not yet. I don't think this is over, <CHARNAME>. He said "we". There are more Fey'ri in Athkatla, and they are looking for something. And there's a good chance that Cirion is with them... I owe that bastard a debt of pain.~
@499  = ~This mission is mine, <CHARNAME>! And now it is personal. We cannot go back to Aran now. We must find out where the other Fey'ri are and stop them, before they can do any harm!~
@500  = ~Alright, I'll help you find Cirion and the other Fey'ri, if it helps you reconcile your past.~
@501  = ~No, Fade, I'm not going to get drawn into this! Come away now, and leave it to Aran!~
@502  = ~While he's alive, none of this is in the "past". I'll only rest when that bastard is dead... preferably by *my* hand. Either you come with me, or you leave me. It's up to you.~
@503  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, truly.~
@504  = ~No, I will not leave this! If you don't want to help, then I will go alone!~
@505  = ~I... I don't know if I can enter this city, <CHARNAME>. I don't think the elves here will appreciate me being here.~
@506  = ~I think the elves have a bit more to worry about at the moment, Fade. I think they are going to be grateful for *any* kind of help!~
@507  = ~These elves are just going to have to like it or lump it! I need you here--don't let them intimidate you.~
@508  = ~Why ever not? You're here to help them--they know this.~
@509  = ~I hope you're right. Pure-blood elves see the Fey'ri as traitors, so don't expect them to be happy to see me.~
@510  = ~Yes, you're right. I'm here to help them--just because I am a Fey'ri doesn't mean I can't help my elven kin, no matter how estranged we are!~
@511  = ~I'm not so sure. Pure-blood elves see the Fey'ri as race traitors, and do *not* take kindly to our presence. But I am here to help them--hopefully they will realise that just because I am a Fey'ri doesn't mean I can't help my elven kin, no matter how estranged we are!~
@512  = ~The Tree... it's so huge! I've never seen anything like this in my life! It's so beautiful... and for some reason, it calls to me. Maybe the Fey'ri are not as estranged from our elven roots as we think we are.~
@513  = ~Hmmm... There are footprints leading up this corridor. I would say they are heading towards the old Temple of Amaunator. I wonder what is of interest to them there.~
@514  = ~So... it is done. My family... as such they were... all dead.~
@515  = ~They were *all* your family?~
@516  = ~Then we are done here. Let us return to Aran and let him know.~
@517  = ~Fade, are you okay?~
@518  = ~Yes. All were brothers and sisters of mine, or cousins. Only my mother now survives, it seems. And Freth, if he survived the Blood War. We should make our way back to Aran. I wish to have... words with him.~
@519  = ~Yes, let us do that. I wish to have... words with him.~
@520  = ~I am fine. Another part of my life has been laid to rest, and I have you to thank for it. Now we should make our way back to Aran. I wish to have... words with him.~
@521  = ~There was no need for that! Mae'Var is the one in the wrong, not that poor sod! You didn't have to kill him!~
@522  = ~May I ask a personal question of you, <CHARNAME>?~
@523  = ~Yes, of course. What do you want to know?~
@524  = ~Maybe later. Now is not such a good time.~
@525  = ~No, you may not. I do not wish to discuss such things with a near-stranger.~
@526  = ~Yes, what *is* it?~
@527  = ~I know that your main goal is to rescue your friend, Imoen. What exactly makes her worth so much effort?~
@528  = ~She's the closest thing I have to a sister, and she's my best friend. We grew up together in Candlekeep, and have been through more together than most people can imagine. I can't *not* rescue her.~
@529  = ~Oh, Imoen. She isn't much to me--we simply grew up together. But I will not suffer anyone to be imprisoned on a lie, and for that reason I must rescue her, as honour dictates.~
@530  = ~I did not realise you wanted to discuss Imoen, Fade, and I must admit I have no interest in talking about our relationship. It is enough that I wish to find her.~
@531  = ~Her capture must be... very hard for you. I can see now why you'd expend so much energy finding her. You... do know where she is, right? What it will take to get her back?~
@532  = ~Yes... and it will continue to get harder. She has been taken to wherever the Cowled Wizards keep their prisoners, along with the mage Irenicus. The Cowled Wizards deemed her a magical deviant, so they just... took her. I can't allow this--we grew up together, and she has stuck by me through everything. I can't abandon her now.~
@533  = ~What do you think? Of course it's hard! We grew up together, fought together, laughed together, cried together... and now she's been taken from me! Damn Irenicus, and damn the Cowled Wizards, and this stupid city's rules about magic! How were we to know? We didn't even know where we were?~
@534  = ~Hard? Hardly. I owe Irenicus a debt of pain. Getting Imoen back... well, I suppose that's just a sort of added bonus. Of the insufferably cheerful kind.~
@535  = ~We may have grown up as siblings, but that doesn't necessarily mean I have to like her. It's Irenicus I'm after. I owe that mage big time.~
@536  = ~No, you can't. A terrible injustice has been done to both you and Imoen and it must be rectified. And I'm glad to help you recover her... I cannot stand to hear of one incarcerated so wrongly.~
@537  = ~Well, I'm glad you're here too. I have the feeling I'm going to need all the help I can muster.~
@538  = ~Thank you... but what's your deal with this whole incarceration business anyway?~
@539  = ~I have a problem with... wrongful incarceration. I cannot help it. But I... do not wish to discuss such things yet, <CHARNAME>. Sorry.~
@540  = ~(She inclines her head to you and then returns to her place in the marching order)~
@541  = ~So I take it you weren't in the vicinity of Athkatla when you were capture by Irenicus?~
@542  = ~No. We were just outside of Baldur's Gate, actually. I think I know why he may be interested in me, but Imoen... I have no idea why he would have wanted her. Damn him! Why make her suffer so?~
@543  = ~No, we weren't. We just defended ourselves against a threat... and due to that, Imoen is gone. I can only blame myself. If I had only stood up to those damn wizards then... ~
@544  = ~Because, sometimes, that is what they want. It hurts just as much to see someone you love suffer. Sometimes even more.~
@545  = ~(She offers you a wan smile) Come on, <CHARNAME>... let's go then, and make Irenicus pay for all he has done to you and your sister.~
@546  = ~And if you had, you'd probably be dead by now. And they would still have Imoen. There's no point in playing the "if only" game, <CHARNAME>. What has happened, has happened, and you're doing all you can to rectify it. Imoen couldn't ask for anything more.~
@547  = ~(She offers you a wan smile) Come on. Let's go and make Irenicus pay for the pain he has caused you and your sister.~
@548  = ~Insufferable? How can you say that about one you have shared so much with?~
@549  = ~Fade, I was joking. Okay, maybe it wasn't in the best possible taste, but it's something Imoen would have appreciated. Come on, I really don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@550  = ~You haven't met Imoen. That's all I can say on the matter. All I can think about now is punishing Irenicus for what he has done to me.~
@551  = ~There's more to life than just revenge, <CHARNAME>. I know this personally. Please do not lose yourself to it.~
@552  = ~(A small smile, almost reassuring, reaches her lips, and with that she takes up her place again in the marching order)~
@553  = ~Honour? Is that all you care for? I would have thought the imprisonment of your friend would mean more to you.~
@554  = ~If you do not have honour, what else do you have? It matters not to me who it is, whether a friend or a stranger.~
@555  = ~Honour is important to me, Fade. Of course I care something for Imoen... we did grow up together. But my honour dictates it doesn't matter who it is. I would still be bound to rescue them.~
@556  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm afraid I have little time for this sort of honour. My friends and loved ones come first, no matter what. I would have hoped you would feel the same.~
@557  = ~(She gives you a slightly withering look and takes up her place once more in the marching order)~
@558  = ~I suppose I can understand that... although I would not have put it in such a way. My friends and loved ones always come first.~
@559  = ~(She gives you a small smile and then returns to her place in the marching order)~
@560  = ~I can understand that sentiment, <CHARNAME>, but sometimes it does help to talk about these things.~
@561  = ~No, it doesn't. So stop snooping.~
@562  = ~Yes, I suppose you're right. What do you want to know about her? She's basically the closest thing I have to a sister. We grew up together in Candlekeep, and have been through much together. I cannot bear to think of her being imprisoned. She is innocent, a victim of circumstance--and I know she would do the same for me if our roles were reversed.~
@563  = ~I see. I shall not disturb you further, then.~
@564  = ~I understand. I only wanted to ask you about Imoen, that's all.~
@565  = ~Oh, is that all? Of course. Ask away.~
@566  = ~I don't think I want to talk about this.~
@567  = ~Can't you take a hint? Go away.~
@568  = ~No, wait, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude or short with you. It's just that all of this... ~
@569  = ~Good.~
@570  = ~(She gives you a rather stern, measured look, but then inclines her head) I suppose I understand. It is about "all of this"... about Imoen... that I wish to ask you about.~
@571  = ~You wanted to ask about Imoen? What do you want to know about her? She's basically the closest thing I have to a sister. We grew up together in Candlekeep, and have been through much together. I cannot bear to think of her being imprisoned. She is innocent, a victim of circumstance--and I know she would do the same for me if our roles were reversed.~
@572  = ~Well, I'm not interested in discussing Imoen with you, Fade. I just want to find her, okay?~
@573  = ~You wanted to ask about Imoen? She isn't much to me--we simply grew up together. But I will not suffer anyone to be imprisoned on a lie, and for that reason I must rescue her, as honour dictates.~
@574  = ~Since you put it that way... nothing important, I'm sure. I will not disturb you further.~
@575  = ~<CHARNAME>, may I ask you a question? I have heard much of your previous exploits in Baldur's Gate--how you averted a war and everything. Is it... all true?~
@576  = ~Yes. All of it's true. I also solved the problem of the iron shortage, stopped major bandit activity in the area... everything.~
@577  = ~Well, I don't know exactly what you've heard, but, yes, I did avert the war... but I couldn't have done it without the help of my companions. They deserve as much of an accolade as I do.~
@578  = ~What? If you've heard of what happened, why ask me? Yes, I did everything that they say I did. Now if you don't mind, I'll get back to more important things than answering stupid questions.~
@579  = ~Well, depending on what you've heard... it's all true. It wasn't easy, though. Many people forget how many of my loved ones and companions died in that time. It's not all glory.~
@580  = ~Really? All of it's true? Even the story where you're seventeen feet tall and skewered ten men at once with one thrust of your mighty sword?~
@581  = ~Okay, I know when I'm being teased. If it's believable, then I probably did it.~
@582  = ~My previous exploits are not to be belittled, Fade. I do not care for your sarcasm.~
@583  = ~Really? People have said that? Wow!~
@584  = ~Yes, things are made so much easier when you have loyal... friends... around you. Still, your accomplishments are quite... heroic, if you don't mind me saying so.~
@585  = ~Oh, I don't know about heroic. Things had to be done. I couldn't just stand there and let everything fall down around my ears. So much was at stake...~
@586  = ~I don't mind at all! Like I said, I had help, but it's still my name that people remember, huh?~
@587  = ~Thank you for the compliment, but... the way you said "friends"... it is as if you haven't had much of a chance to use the word before.~
@588  = ~I see. I was going to congratulate you on your accomplishments, but I see your head is already swollen enough. I am sorry to have bothered you with such trivial matters.~
@589  = ~Yes, I have to agree with you. People tend to forget the great cost one has to pay when undertaking such tasks... all that is remembered is the glory. I am sorry for your loss.~
@590  = ~That's all right. Although sometimes I feel their loss acutely, life must go on. Sitting and brooding about the dead doesn't bring them back, nor does it do their memory any favours.~
@591  = ~I do not wish to discuss my former companions with you, Fade. You are here to assist me, not probe my inner psyche. Do not bother me with such trivial matters again.~
@592  = ~We all love and lose, Fade. And unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it, no matter who we are.~
@593  = ~(grin) I'm sorry... I couldn't resist! Still, even after picking through some of the more... fantastic tales of your exploits, they are still quite extraordinary. But there again, I suppose you couldn't be anything less, if rumours are to be believed about your apparent heritage.~
@594  = ~And what do these rumours say?~
@595  = ~And just what do you mean by that? What have you heard?~
@596  = ~I suppose you're right. Being a child of Bhaal certainly makes life a bit more interesting!~
@597  = ~I was not belittling you, <CHARNAME>. I was only trying to bring a little levity to the conversation. I am actually quite impressed by your previous deeds... but not by your attitude.~
@598  = ~Then perhaps you should shut up and fall back into line? I do not tolerate such commentary from my lackeys.~
@599  = ~Please forgive my defensive stance, Fade. It's just... (sigh) let's just say people aren't always so complimentary.~
@600  = ~Yes, people have said that, and more! They also speak of your... apparent heritage.~
@601  = ~Oh, there's nothing apparent about it--I'm a child of Bhaal. You needn't beat around the bush about it.~
@602  = ~There is no need to be bashful, <CHARNAME>--you have much to be proud of. You have achieved so much, and people respect you, even though they know of your... apparent heritage.~
@603  = ~Apparent heritage? What do you mean?~
@604  = ~And why should people not respect me? I am a child of Bhaal--I cannot help it.~
@605  = ~Was that a compliment or an insult, Fade? I know people can sometimes find the fact that I am a child of Bhaal hard to swallow, but it's their problem, not mine. Does it bother you?~
@606  = ~I do not care for your tone, Fade. What does my heritage have to do with this?~
@607  = ~Yes, although much of that is probably due to the rumours surrounding your heritage, don't you think? What would you pick? A lowly ranger or cleric, or the child of the dead Lord of Murder?~
@608  = ~I suppose you're right. How did you know I'm a child of Bhaal?~
@609  = ~What do you mean by that? What have you heard?~
@610  = ~I... I...~
@611  = ~(sigh) No, <CHARNAME>, I have not had much cause to use that word in conjunction with myself. Although I hope that will change.~
@612  = ~It already has. How do you feel about being a friend of a child of Bhaal?~
@613  = ~Well, don't get your hopes up too high. Come on, we'd better catch up with the others.~
@614  = ~I can only agree with you there, <CHARNAME>. Many would say that such sentiments would be incomprehensible to one of your apparent heritage, but I am glad that they are wrong.~
@615  = ~And why would they say that? I may be a child of Bhaal, but it doesn't mean I don't have feelings.~
@616  = ~And I'm glad that you can see that... and that my being a child of Bhaal doesn't bother you.~
@617  = ~That... that you are a child of Bhaal, the dead Lord of Murder. Is it... true?~
@618  = ~Yes, it's true. Does it bother you?~
@619  = ~Ahh, so we get back to that, do we? Well, I'm not prepared to discuss it with you, Fade--not now, not ever! Understand?~
@620  = ~Yes, it's true, but I don't like to discuss it. Can you just leave it? Please?~
@621  = ~So you... admit your heritage? I was quite worried to mention it, just in case--~
@622  = ~I denied it and got angry? Don't worry, Fade. Unless it bothers you.~
@623  = ~Well, now you have confirmation, can we just drop it? Please?~
@624  = ~Yes, I can understand your reaction. Your apparent heritage cannot be an easy thing to deal with sometimes.~
@625  = ~No, it doesn't. I feel honoured to travel with you, to be a part of your adventure.~
@626  = ~Rumours, mainly. So, it's true then?~
@627  = ~I... I feel honoured to travel with you, to be a part of your adventure. And I feel even more honoured now you consider me a friend. Thank you.~
@628  = ~I don't say that at all. Others might, but not me. I feel honoured to travel with you, to be a part of your adventure.~
@629  = ~(smile) As you wish, <CHARNAME>.~
@630  = ~If that's the way you like it, fine. You won't hear from me on the subject ever again.~
@631  = ~Yes, I suppose we'd better, at that. Let's go.~
@632  = ~<CHARNAME>... Do you wish to ask me something? I see you giving me puzzled looks a lot recently--what is on your mind?~
@633  = ~It's nothing really, Fade. Don't worry about it.~
@634  = ~Actually, I just... well... I don't want to be rude, but... why *do* you have a tail? If that isn't a personal question, of course.~
@635  = ~Nothing to worry over, it's simply that you aren't quite like other elves I've met before.~
@636  = ~(laugh) I'll make up my own mind what worries me and what doesn't! I would rather you told me what it was, though.~
@637  = ~Okay then. It's just that, well, you have a tail. Obviously I noticed it as soon as we met, but...~
@638  = ~Like I said, it's nothing really. It's just that you're not quite like any other elf I've ever met before.~
@639  = ~(smile) I wondered when you would ask me that, <CHARNAME>, and I don't mind at all. I'm from a race of elves known as the Fey'ri.~
@640  = ~The what? I've never heard of the Fey'ri before.~
@641  = ~Aren't they the elven equivalent of tieflings? Doesn't that mean you have a demonic ancestor?~
@642  = ~The Fey'ri? You're a demonic elf? I've heard of your people, but I never thought I'd actually meet one.~
@643  = ~(smile) That's because I'm not like other elves. I'm a Fey'ri. Do you... know what a Fey'ri is?~
@644  = ~No, I've never heard of them.~
@645  = ~I'm not quite sure... aren't they like the elven equivalent of tieflings? You know, people who have a demonic ancestor?~
@646  = ~Yes, of course I do. The Fey'ri are elves with demonic blood. I never thought I'd meet one, though.~
@647  = ~...and you didn't know how to approach me about it? Many people say that. I have a tail because I am a Fey'ri. Do you know what a Fey'ri is?~
@648  = ~Aren't they a bit like tieflings? But elves instead of humans? You mean you have a demonic ancestor?~
@649  = ~Yes, actually, I have heard of your people. I did wonder... but I never actually thought I'd ever meet one.~
@650  = ~The Fey'ri are a race of Sun elves who have... Tan'ari ancestors. We hail from the Hellgate in the High Forest to the North.~
@651  = ~My grandfather is a Cambion... a half demon. Does this... bother you?~
@652  = ~Yes, a little. It didn't even cross my mind that you might be part Tan'ari. Doesn't that mean your people are evil?~
@653  = ~No... should it?~
@654  = ~I judge people by their actions, Fade, not by their heritage. Considering what I am, it seems only logical.~
@655  = ~Yes, it does! If I had known, I would never have allowed one of such an evil heritage into my party!~
@656  = ~Yes, we are like tieflings. We share a demonic heritage, although we do not hail form the planes. We come from the Hellgate, north of here, from the High Forest.~
@657  = ~No, not at all. Should it?~
@658  = ~Well, yes, a little bit. I did wonder if this was the case... but I have heard that your people are savage and evil. Is this true?~
@659  = ~Why should it? I judge people by their actions, Fade. I myself have an unusual heritage, as you know--it would be rather presumptuous of me to judge others in a way I would not want to be judged.~
@660  = ~Yes, of course it does! I had my suspicions all along, and now they have been confirmed! I should never have allowed you to join up with me.~
@661  = ~You have heard of us? I'm a bit surprised at that. There aren't many of us around. How did you find out about us?~
@662  = ~I grew up in the fortress of Candlekeep. They have a huge library--the whole Hellgate Saga is chronicled there. So I know all about your people.~
@663  = ~I have an... interest in such things.~
@664  = ~Depends on what you mean by evil. Yes, they are cruel and savage, and many people would consider them evil... but that is just their way. They honestly don't know any different.~
@665  = ~And you think that excuses them?~
@666  = ~But obviously you do. What makes you so different from them?~
@667  = ~Really? You surprise me, <CHARNAME>. Many people get quite... upset when I admit to them what I am. They think my heritage makes me a demon too.~
@668  = ~Well, apart from a bit of a temper and a blatant disregard for the concept known as "other people's possessions", you don't seem too demonic to me, Fade.~
@669  = ~It can happen. Some people have difficulty seeing beyond what you are, and seem incapable of seeing who you are. I have had the same problem in the past. It is why I do not judge, you know.~
@670  = ~Oh, sod other people, Fade. You know what you are, and that's all that matters.~
@671  = ~I can see many advantages to that, Fade. I'm sure that if you let people think you were a demon, they would do as you wished. And that can't be a bad thing.~
@672  = ~I am most thankful for that, <CHARNAME>. And it is good to have met someone who knows what it is like to be judged on their heritage alone... you know how it feels. I am glad it does not bother you.~
@673  = ~Your heritage may not bother me, but please do not think this means I have dismissed all my misgivings over you. I will not judge you, but I still do not entirely trust you.~
@674  = ~(smile) Good. And I'm glad that you've been honest with me.~
@675  = ~Well, I'm glad we've got that out of the way. Now we can continue to pursue Irenicus.~
@676  = ~Yes, we should get going.~
@677  = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, that you feel that way. I suppose I should have... expected such a response. But I cannot help it... this is the way I was made.~
@678  = ~(sigh) I suppose I should gather my things. I will be gone as soon I can.~
@679  = ~Good! And good riddance!~
@680  = ~No, Fade, I didn't mean it like that. I overreacted. It's just a bit of a shock, finding out one of your companions is a part demon. Please forgive my hasty words.~
@681  = ~No, stay here. I still need your help. Just... stay away from me.~
@682  = ~I'm sorry it has come to this, <CHARNAME>. But if ever you decide you need my help again, I will be at my guildhouse.~
@683  = ~And so does that... bother you? Considering all you know about us?~
@684  = ~I'm not sure... maybe a little bit. Are they all as evil as the chronicles say?~
@685  = ~Yes, to be honest, it does. I know what Fey'ri are, and I suspected all along you were one. I should never have allowed you to join up with me.~
@686  = ~An interest? Such interests can be bad for you, <CHARNAME>... the Abyss and its denizens are best left alone. Believe me.~
@687  = ~Why? Simply because they are viewed by the majority as evil? Are they truly as evil as people deem them?~
@688  = ~I suppose you would know. Have you had many dealings with the Abyss?~
@689  = ~(snort) I'm not about to take advice from you, Fade. My interest has never brought me to harm.~
@690  = ~I didn't say that. Even if they did know any different, I doubt they would change. Too much of their behaviour is bred into them.~
@691  = ~But you're not like that, are you? What makes you different?~
@692  = ~It still doesn't excuse them. They should be wiped from the face of Faerun.~
@693  = ~But you seem different. Apart from a bit of a temper and a blatant disregard for the concept known as "other people's possessions", you don't seem too demonic to me.~
@694  = ~I... I've experienced things other Fey'ri have not. It's given me a unique view of the world. I don't consider myself different from my kin, it's just... (sigh)~
@695  = ~You've discovered compassion and empathy. You've offered yourself to my cause, and said you wanted to help me. That's not the kind of behaviour I'd normally expect from one of your kind.~
@696  = ~What kind of things? What have you experienced?~
@697  = ~(laugh) I know when I'm being teased, <CHARNAME>! But I suppose there's a grain of truth to that. I am not the norm amongst my kin. I... I've experienced things other Fey'ri have not. It's left me with a different view of the world. Truthfully, I don't consider myself any better or worse than my kin, it's just that...~
@698  = ~(laugh) Thank you for that! And you are absolutely correct! I know who I am--who cares what other people think?~
@699  = ~Sometimes I worry that I won't be accepted... but whether you meant it or not, I have never heard a truer word spoken in jest.~
@700  = ~I didn't mean it that way, <CHARNAME>. It's a disadvantage, not an advantage for me. I... I don't want people to do as I want because they fear me, I just want to make my own way in this life.~
@701  = ~(sigh) I suppose I can understand that. We haven't traveled together for long. I supposed I hoped you had overcome your misgivings, but... (shrug) early days yet.~
@702  = ~I see no reason not to be honest with you, especially about this. I could hardly lie to you, anyway--the tail and the red eyes are a bit of a giveaway!~
@703  = ~And what chance do I have of you ever trusting me if I'm not honest with you about something as fundamental as my ancestry? Because I do want you to trust me.~
@704  = ~(She stops tightening the straps on her backpack and just looks at you. After a while, she gives you a slightly hurt smile) Fair enough... I forgive you. Just please remember in the future "do not judge others lest ye be judged yourself".~
@705  = ~You think to insult me, then demand I stay? Well, you are sadly mistaken!~
@706  = ~Not many... but enough to last me this lifetime. (shudder) The Tan'ari normally come to us for... whatever reason. I don't really like talking about it. Lets just say its name barely does it justice.~
@707  = ~But that's part of your heritage, why fear it like that? What makes you so different from other Fey'ri?~
@708  = ~You haven't come to any harm... yet. All it takes is one of the Demon Lords to realize that a Bhaalspawn has taken an interest in them. I think the phrase commonly used is "a snowball's chance in hell", yes? Because that's what you'd have.~
@709  = ~Not that I'd know. About the snowball in hell, I mean. I haven't been there. But if you do insist in continuing this... interest, well... just be careful.~
@710  = ~I do not need you to tell me how to conduct my interests, so butt out.~
@711  = ~I suppose I never thought about it like that before. Thank you for your concern, and I will be careful.~
@712  = ~I was only showing a little friendly concern, but since it's obviously not to your taste... very well, I shall refrain from making that mistake ever again.~
@713  = ~I certainly hope you will, <CHARNAME>. I'd hate to have to wake up someday and find you a little heap of ash, or worse.~
@714  = ~You say that about my people? And then what? Wipe out the Drow? Then the Orc Hordes? The Frost Giants? How long before you then become the "evil" one, feared by all? That kind of thinking soon snowballs, <CHARNAME>.~
@715  = ~So what would you suggest? Live and let live? Let the evil-doers prey on the weak and innocent forever more? No! We must take action!~
@716  = ~I suppose there is some wisdom in those words. How long does it take before the freedom fighters become the oppressors? (sigh) It's not easy, is it? What would you suggest?~
@717  = ~You are far too kind to me, <CHARNAME>, but I am far from this picture you have painted of me. I... just know I have to help. If this is compassion, well... Thank you. For giving me a chance.~
@718  = ~I... I can't say. Not yet. I know you have misgivings about having me here, but I must also know I can trust you first. I'm... sorry.~
@719  = ~And what do you think people will say when they hear that a Child of Bhaal, the Lord of Murder, has gone on a killing spree, even if it against so called "evil-doers"? Talk sense, <CHARNAME>.~
@720  = ~How dare you speak to me in such a manner, Fade? I do not know why I even deign to speak to one such as you.~
@721  = ~Hmm. I suppose I can see your point. It wouldn't be easy as all that. So what would you suggest?~
@722  = ~Oh, so the conversation of one "such as me" isn't good enough for our resident <PRO_LORDLADY> of Murder? Very well, I'll make sure your divine ears aren't bothered with it again, ever!~
@723  = ~No, it wouldn't be easy. And if I knew the answer... well, I certainly wouldn't be a Shadow Thief lackey! I suppose we just have to go along our own paths, doing things as we see fit. It's all anyone can ask.~
@724  = ~(shrug) Come on... such thinking is giving me a headache!~
@725  = ~So, <CHARNAME>, we've spoken of your previous exploits, but what made you choose to take up the adventuring life in the first place?~
@726  = ~I didn't so much choose it as have it thrust upon me. I never wanted to be an adventurer originally--I wanted to be a scribe.~
@727  = ~I didn't so much choose it as have it thrust upon me. I never wanted to be an adventurer originally--I wanted to be a farrier.~
@728  = ~I didn't so much choose it as have it thrust upon me. I never wanted to be an adventurer originally--I wanted to be a healer.~
@729  = ~I didn't so much choose it as have it thrust upon me. I never wanted to be an adventurer originally--I wanted to take up some other profession altogether.~
@730  = ~That is a difficult question for me to answer. My first foray into adventuring was not a pleasant experience.~
@731  = ~I do not wish to discuss such matters with you, Fade. Please leave me be.~
@732  = ~I think I was always destined for the Life, but I did take it up earlier than I had anticipated, that's for sure!~
@733  = ~That is indeed interesting! So you never wanted to be an adventurer?~
@734  = ~I didn't say that! I must admit, I never really considered the Life as much of an option for me--I thought I'd live and die within the confines of Candlekeep.~
@735  = ~No, not really. I was more than happy to be a nobody. Funny how Fate plays tricks on you like that.~
@736  = ~Well, I wouldn't say "never"... I just thought being an adventurer was more of a faerie-dream for me. I thought I'd never get the chance. How wrong I was!~
@737  = ~Ah... yes. I have heard about Gorion. He was your foster father, wasn't he?~
@738  = ~He was my... what? How in the Hells do you know about that?~
@739  = ~Yes, Gorion was my foster father. I see even *that* bit of my history precedes me--is nothing sacred?~
@740  = ~Yes... he was my foster father. Can we please talk about something else? This is too painful.~
@741  = ~I am sorry--I should have been more sensitive in my question. Of course you didn't choose.~
@742  = ~How do you know I didn't choose the Life? What have you been told?~
@743  = ~By that response, I would assume you already know the answer. If that is the case, I caution you to remember what I said about spying on me.~
@744  = ~Really? What then forced you to take to the road before you were ready?~
@745  = ~Personal things. Things that never should have happened. Things I would prevent from happening if I could go back.~
@746  = ~There was a threat... At the time, I didn't even realize it was aimed at me. I thought Gorion, my foster father, and I were going on a regular trip. How wrong I was.~
@747  = ~I... I am sorry, Fade. I really don't want to discuss this with you. It is... too painful. Can we talk about something else?~
@748  = ~So what changed all that? If adventuring was never your intention in the first place... it's not an easy life.~
@749  = ~A nobody? The famous <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep? I can hardly see that!~
@750  = ~Believe me, it what I would have preferred, given the choice again! That way, Gorion wouldn't have... would still be...~
@751  = ~Famous? Hardly. A few people have heard the name and they think they know me. Nothing could be further from the truth.~
@752  = ~There is no need to mock me, Fade. Like I said, I didn't choose this life.~
@753  = ~So you had your whole life mapped out, huh? And is it everything you believed it would be?~
@754  = ~No, not really. I suppose you could say I had a rather romanticized view of what living on the road would be like. I didn't realise mud featured so prominently!~
@755  = ~Yes, it is. And now I'm here, I love it! This life is everything I thought it would be.~
@756  = ~The Life is okay, I suppose... but my enthusiasm for it has definitely been dampened by the price I had to pay to live it.~
@757  = ~Your reputation precedes you somewhat... and it also helps when you work for an organisation that thrives on information. Let us say that you have not trodden lightly upon the world and leave it at that.~
@758  = ~No, we're not going to leave it at that! I'm just a bit sick and tired of everyone knowing my business. It's getting very tiresome!~
@759  = ~By "organisation" I assume you're referring to the Shadow Thieves. In that case, I caution you to remember what I said previously about spying on me.~
@760  = ~I suppose you have the right of it. Considering what has happened, it is inevitable that such stories would travel. (sigh) Even thought some of them are intensely personal.~
@761  = ~To the rumour mills and gossip-mongerers? No, I'm afraid not. You've acquired a certain level of celebrity, <CHARNAME>, and there isn't any escape from it. Although it was tactless of me to highlight this fact the way I did... and for that, I apologise.~
@762  = ~No need to apologise--you're absolutely correct. I just can't get used to it. Half of it is blown out of all proportion anyway, and the other half is mostly tripe!~
@763  = ~Ah, forget it. It's not your fault rumour got here before I did. I suppose I should thank you for letting me know exactly how far such stories have travelled.~
@764  = ~Yes, mentioning Gorion like that was possibly not the most sensitive thing you could have done. Can we talk about something else now? I... I don't want to discuss such things further at the moment.~
@765  = ~Of... of course we can. I didn't mean to upset you. Perhaps it would be better if I just left you alone.~
@766  = ~No, it's okay. Lets just change the subject. How about you? Have you done much adventuring?~
@767  = ~Yes, perhaps it would be for the best. I know you mean well, but... tact isn't your strong point, is it?~
@768  = ~It's not you who's upset me... just the memories. But I would appreciate a little time to myself right now.~
@769  = ~Nothing! I have just heard about Gorion. He was your foster father, wasn't he?~
@770  = ~Well, I was told... before I asked to join you... about your foster father, Gorion. How he was killed and that his death forced you down the adventurer's path.~
@771  = ~Don't gawk at me--your reputation precedes you somewhat. And it also helps when you work for an organisation that thrives on information. Let us say that you have not trodden lightly upon the world and leave it at that.~
@772  = ~I'm not spying on you, <CHARNAME>! This information was entrusted to me before I joined your party. Everything you have told me since I joined you, I have kept to myself!~
@773  = ~I know you have a hard time believing it, but I am not here to spy on you. I am here to *help* you!~
@774  = ~Okay, okay, don't get your knickers in a knot!  I actually don't have that hard a time believing you--I just suppose I'm a bit sensitive to the constant invasion of my privacy. Everyone seems to know my business these days, and it's getting very tiresome!~
@775  = ~Even so, Fade, I know you would tell the Shadow Master everything about me if he asked, and I must admit, I don't like that at all. Maybe it would be better if you kept your distance from me.~
@776  = ~Fade, please, I'm just teasing you! I know you're not spying on me, and I know I can trust you. Don't get so worked up!~
@777  = ~Yes... Gorion. What happened to him must have come as terrible blow.~
@778  = ~A "terrible blow"? It was a bit more than that! Anyway, how in the Hells do *you* know what happened?~
@779  = ~It was a bit more than a "terrible blow", Fade. I see even *that* bit of my history precedes me--is nothing sacred?~
@780  = ~Fade... please... I really don't want to discuss this right now. Can we talk about something else? This is getting far too painful for me.~
@781  = ~Maybe you are right. However, I don't think you realise quite how far tales of your exploits have traveled. You are something of a celebrity, whether you like it or not! (grin)~
@782  = ~In that case, I don't like it, not one bit. (sigh) I just wish people would leave me alone and let me get on with my life. If only I'd been left alone in the first place... if they hadn't come after me...~
@783  = ~(grin) Like it or lump it, huh? I just can't get used to it, that's all. I mean, you know what happened. I sometimes feel as if that happened to someone else, some great hero who just happens to share my name and history. Silly, isn't it?~
@784  = ~I never thought about it like that before! Do you think that those stories might get me a few free ales in the odd tavern?~
@785  = ~Oh, I'm not mocking you--I just find it a quite amusing that one who did not actively seek such notoriety should find it anyway. There are plenty of others who would love your status!~
@786  = ~If that's the case, then they're welcome to it. (sigh) I just wish people would leave me alone and let me get on with my life. If only I'd been left alone in the first place... if they hadn't come after me...~
@787  = ~Well, I'm glad you find my situation funny. Maybe others would like to have their family members murdered and be chased halfway across the Sword Coast by assassins, if it leads to the notoriety they so crave.~
@788  = ~(laugh) No one warns you of that, do they? Mud and rain... give me a comfortable bed and a warm fire over the cold hard ground any day of the month!~
@789  = ~You think that too? So why on earth did you want to come adventuring with me? You had the choice *not* to live like this!~
@790  = ~Yes, I know what you mean! Still, there are harder ways of making a living, I suppose. It's certainly preferable to being saddled with a doltish husband not of your choosing and being expected to bear hundreds of children!~
@791  = ~Yes, I know what you mean! Still, there are harder ways of making a living, I suppose. It's certainly preferable to being saddled with a nagging wife not of your choosing and being expected to feed hundreds of hungry mouths!~
@792  = ~Yes... and a nice family to be with you, all the time.~
@793  = ~(grin) It *is* a lot of fun, isn't it? Seeing new places, making new friends... that alone makes up for the rain and sleeping on rough ground!~
@794  = ~(laugh) There's nothing wrong with rough ground and rain!  If you feel that way, why did you want to come adventuring with me in the first place? You had the choice *not* to live like this!~
@795  = ~There are definitely harder ways of making a living, that's for sure! It's certainly preferable to being saddled with a doltish husband not of your choosing and being expected to bear hundreds of children!~
@796  = ~There are definitely harder ways of making a living, that's for sure! It's certainly preferable to being saddled with a nagging wife not of your choosing and being expected to feed hundreds of hungry mouths!~
@797  = ~Totally! So how about you? Have you done much adventuring before this?~
@798  = ~CHARNAME>, I can sympathise with your situation, but such is life, I'm afraid! You are something of a celebrity, whether you like it or not! (grin)~
@799  = ~Unfortunately, that is always going to be the case--and even more unfortunately, there is going to be little you can do about it.~
@800  = ~Whatever happens, though, you must remember that the only ones who matter are those you love and respect, be they alive or dead. Just, you know... live your life as you want to. Forget everyone else and their silly tattle-tales!~
@801  = ~That's true... you wouldn't believe half the stuff that's circulating around. According to some, you're part ancient dragon, part demon, part god... well, I suppose *that* bit is true, but not in the way the gossipers mean it. My advice is just try to ignore it all.~
@802  = ~Well, in that case, you're most welcome. (smile) My advice is just try to ignore it all.~
@803  = ~Not too much. Not out of choice, anyway. I've traveled about a bit, but that wasn't for any great purpose. Just to, you know, get away from places, make new starts, things like that...~
@804  = ~Err... Fade? Are you in some kind of trouble?~
@805  = ~Yes, I can sympathise with that. Sometimes I just wish I could leave and go somewhere where no one knows anything about me. Maybe once all this is over and done with, I too will be able to make a new start.~
@806  = ~Possibly not... although I don't think it's yours either.~
@807  = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. Just... please know that if you do ever need someone to talk to, I am here for you, okay? You shouldn't have to bear all your grief alone.~
@808  = ~As you would have it, <CHARNAME>. I only wished to be your friend... but I see that will never be. You will never truly trust me.~
@809  = ~You're... teasing me? Then you have a very strange sense of humour <CHARNAME>. No matter. As long as you do trust me, that's all I care about!~
@810  = ~No, it's not silly, not at all. A lot has happened to you in a short space of time, and I have great respect for how you have coped through your trials... but of course it's going to feel a little surreal at times.~
@811  = ~You just need to learn to ignore the gossip, because that's all it is--gossip. The only ones who count are those whom you love and respect, and they won't judge you. Just live your life the way *you* want to, and don't let anyone else tell you any different!~
@812  = ~(laugh) I'm sure they would! As long as I get a cut... I *did* give you the idea after all!~
@813  = ~<CHARNAME>, please... I wasn't trying to upset you! I'm just saying that this is how some people view you! I'm not belittling you in any way, in fact I have great respect for how you have coped through your trials.~
@814  = ~You just need to learn to ignore the gossip, because that's all it is--gossip. The only ones who count are those whom you love and respect, and they won't judge you. Come now, let's stop such morbid talk and speak of other things!~
@815  = ~Yes, I know. But I also like the excitement and the opportunity to, you know, meet new people... and their wealth! (grin)~
@816  = ~Fade, there's more to life than pursuing sparkly baubles! How about helping people in need, and bettering yourself? Surely that's more of a reason to go adventuring?~
@817  = ~(grin) Now you're talking! You've got to ensure you have enough tucked away for retirement, don't you? And some stories to get you a few free ales in your dotage.~
@818  = ~These are the reasons you want to adventure? I thought you wanted to help, that you wanted to make a difference! But I should have guessed... once a thief, always a thief! Well, such sentiments will not be tolerated in this group! I will not allow my quest to be used as an excuse for you to indulge in your passion for petty larceny!~
@819  = ~(shudder) I can only agree with you there. Can you imagine it? At least being an adventurer means there's more to life than being kept barefoot and pregnant by some idiot man who thinks that's all you're good for.~
@820  = ~(grin) We get to have fun! And see the world!~
@821  = ~Of course you're right... but sometimes my enthusiasm for it is definitely  dampened by the price I had to pay to live it.~
@822  = ~(raise your waterskin) Here's to female empowerment! Never again will our destinies be decided with us purely on our backs!~
@823  = ~(shudder) I can only agree with you there. Can you imagine it? At least being an adventurer means there's more to life than being trapped in some deplorable hovel, scratching a living from nothing.~
@824  = ~Unless you're a noble, of course.~
@825  = ~I take it by that you're referring to Gorion? I have heard of him. He was your foster father, wasn't he?~
@826  = ~Of course not! No... don't be silly!~
@827  = ~(sigh) I can't get much past you, can I? What I meant was... I'm not in trouble anymore. It's nothing for you to be concerned about, <CHARNAME>, just the one of the trials of being a lone Fey'ri. Let's just concentrate on the task in hand, okay? There's no point dwelling on the past.~
@828  = ~And I'm sure you will do. Just don't disappear totally, okay? Because the rest of us would miss you terribly!~
@829  = ~Maybe for you, but I defy any adventurer to pass up an opportunity to get his or her hands on something valuable!~
@830  = ~Ahhh... I guess you're right. I'm not here to line my purse--I'm here to help you. Gods, <CHARNAME>, you're turning me into a bloody Paladin! Now, that just won't do! (grin)~
@831  = ~Ahhh... I see you understand me implicitly! Although I don't think I'm one for squirreling all my wealth away, mind you. The tales alone would probably have to pay my way!~
@832  = ~(grin) Shall we be off, then? I'm sure there are a lot of baubles out there, just waiting for us to claim them.~
@833  = ~Whoa! <CHARNAME>, calm down! I wasn't being serious, you know! I'm not here just to line my purse--I'm here to help you in anyway I can! I like you and all, but I really do think you need to discover a sense of humour sometimes.~
@834  = ~(laugh) I'll definitely drink to that!~
@835  = ~(grin) Are you trying to get a rise out of me, <CHARNAME>?~
@836  = ~Now would I do a thing like that?~
@837  = ~No, I'm being serious. Not everyone who doesn't adventure lives in a hovel. some farmers, for example, do very well for themselves...~
@838  = ~Yes, I get the feeling you would! (laugh)~
@839  = ~<CHARNAME>, I was joking! Sheesh, you're way too serious for your own good sometimes, you know that? Lighten up a bit and have some fun!~
@840  = ~Hmmm. I wonder if they have a list of bounties.~
@841  = ~You're not funny, Thayvian.~
@842  = ~Who said I was joking?~
@843  = ~But Fade, I thought that all those of an elven heritage had an inherent love of nature, and--~
@844  = ~Don't you start with that elvish nonsense! I wouldn't know the difference between a sodding oak and a buggering elm if they both came up and bit me on the arse! I'm a city girl--give me cobbled streets, smoky taverns and an easy mark any day!~
@845  = ~You complete bastard! I *knew* there was something dodgy about you all along! How could you travel with us for so long, just to do this to <CHARNAME>? I should gut you where you stand!~
@846  = ~Quickly, go to her! She is slipping away... give her a reason to stay with you!~
@847  = ~(go to Fade at once)~
@848  = ~But she may still be dangerous!~
@849  = ~Do you love her or not? Go to her, before you lose her!~
@850  = ~Possibly... maybe they got between them and the nearest bakery? Sorry, sorry... bad taste, I know. I'll just... go over and stand there, shall I?~
@851  = ~Wow. You're very... shiny, aren't you?~
@852  = ~(ahem!) As I said, <CHARNAME>, I have been following your progress with great interest.~
@853  = ~<CHARNAME>, no! You can't deal in that! If you do... I'm leaving.~
@854  = ~You'll leave? Okay, if that's the case, no, I don't want anything to do with the slave trade.~
@855  = ~Leave then! I need all the money I can get my hands on.~
@856  = ~What is this, <CHARNAME>?~
@857  = ~Well, the obvious answer would be "a blade", but I doubt that's what you meant. I thought you might like it, Fade. Besides, you're the only one here who can use it, so I guess you're stuck with it now.~
@858  = ~It's my gift to you, Fade. The blade is called Uulia'Moor, "The Playful Scar". It is a blade forged by your people, to be used *only* by your people. May serve you well.~
@859  = ~What do you think it is? Of course it's a blade! Take it, make good use of it, and make sure nobody is left alive to talk about it.~
@860  = ~I don't understand. Why would you give me such a thing?~
@861  = ~Do I need a reason? I thought you would like it. That's reason enough for me.~
@862  = ~Because we need the best possible equipment if we want to survive, Fade.~
@863  = ~Have you ever heard about Uulia'Moor, <CHARNAME>? It belonged to someone with a really, *really* bad reputation. I hope you don't think I'm as bloodthirsty as Slythithia.~
@864  = ~Err... who?~
@865  = ~I guess I should have asked a little bit more about the blade's history. But if anyone can undo this sword's bad reputation, it would be you.~
@866  = ~The shopkeeper mentioned something to that effect. It made me think of you, actually.~
@867  = ~Didn't the shopkeeper who sold you this sword tell you anything about its history? Hrmph. Typical, I suppose. Slythithia the Gloomgiver was the fey'ri assassin who commissioned this blade. She was vicious, bloodthirsty, and insatiable. She killed hundreds -- thousands -- including many innocent villagers.~
@868  = ~Your expectations of me may be a little bit too high, but... thank you.~
@869  = ~(Her eyes flash) I am *nothing* like her! All right? I am NOTHING like her!~
@870  = ~(Much more sedately) It *is* a beautiful blade. Was it... expensive?~
@871  = ~You're not supposed to ask how much a gift costs, you know.~
@872  = ~More than your weight in gold, but I think it was worth it.~
@873  = ~Yes, but if you don't like it we can always sell it or take it back...~
@874  = ~(Sigh) You really should have asked my opinion before buying me something like this.~
@875  = ~No! I mean... It's not like that...~
@876  = ~I just... Well, you should have known I would have doubts about using the instrument of some... some *serial killer*, let alone the worst ambassador of my kind that ever walked the face of Toril! But on the other hand I don't get gifts very often, especially one as... incredible... as this one, and from such an incredible person.~
@877  = ~Well, it's yours, and you can decide whether to keep it or throw it away... or for that matter you can sell it and buy yourself a sword that you actually want.~
@878  = ~Then it's settled. Take the blade and use it. That's not a request, it's an order. We're going to fight Irenicus and we need the best weapons we can possibly get. And this one is yours.~
@879  = ~...~
@880  = ~I'll keep it. It's a wonderful gift, and it's from you... although next time maybe we should stick to the jewelry and chocolates, maybe a nice new pair of boots, or-- (She catches sight of your weary look.) Hey, it's not exactly something I would have bought for myself, but it's beautiful and sharp -- kinda like me, actually -- and... thank you. Like I said, I don't get gifts very often, and it was really sweet of you to think of me.~
@881  = ~Oh, *really*? Hmph! You'd better watch that nasty little tongue of yours, <CHARNAME>, or I might just use my fancy new blade to cut it off. (*Grumble*) "An order"... pfeh!~
@882  = ~But, before that... I, ah, just remembered something I have to do. I wonder, Fade, if you and your companions could help me with a... small task?~
@883  = ~Of course. Right, <CHARNAME>?~
@884  = ~As long as it doesn't take too long.~
@885  = ~No, we're running out of time. Let's just sort out this guild business.~
@886  = ~No, it won't take long. I just need someone I can trust to run a rather... delicate errand for me. I need some funds dropped off to my mother.~
@887  = ~Er, no disrespect, sir, but I've done this before, and I don't think your mother, errr, likes me very much. Isn't there anyone else you can send?~
@888  = ~Oddly enough, Fade, I think you are one of very few whom my mother will let into the house. She... gets confused easily.~
@889  = ~(mutter) "Confused", my arse. She's insane!~
@890  = ~Good. Here's the pouch I need you to deliver, and--just a little word of warning, Fade--don't bother trying to slit it open or picking at the seals. I'll know if you have.~
@891  = ~You know where my mother's house is, of course--northeast side of the Bridge District, the one with the fish stall outside. Talk pleasantries and tell her I'd love to visit, but I'm just too busy at the moment. You know the drill.~
@892  = ~(sigh) Yes, sir.~
@893  = ~Aran's "delicate errand".

Fade has agreed to help Aran deliver some funds to his mother, as amazing as the idea of a Shadowmaster being filial may seem. Mrs. Linvail's home is on the northeast side of the Bridge District.~
@894  = ~Ah, I see you have returned. How is my mother?~
@895  = ~As dreadful as usual.~
@896  = ~Well, it's a necessary evi--I mean, I have to look after my dear old mother in her dotage, don't I?~
@897  = ~All right, then. Back to the matter of eliminating this Bodhi and her vampiric guild.~
@898  = ~If we are to make any headway, this rival guild must be destroyed, or at least subdued. And you, <CHARNAME>, will have to bear the brunt of that.~
@899  = ~To that end, I have another offer to make. This is Fade, and she is one of my finest sneaks. She wishes to help you, and I have agreed to her request... if you want her help, that is.~
@900  = ~And why would she wish to do that?~
@901  = ~Why would I want one of your spies in my group, Aran? I have no doubt this is a ploy of yours to keep an eye on me.~
@902  = ~I am grateful for the offer, Aran, but I have enough travelling companions and have no wish for any more. Sorry.~
@903  = ~While she would still be under my command, <CHARNAME>, I assure you that Fade wishes to do this herself--I have not forced her in any way. She approached me, and I agree that you may find her skills very useful. Your story has... touched her, you see.~
@904  = ~Touched her? What do you mean by that?~
@905  = ~Fair enough then. I will accept her into the party.~
@906  = ~Although I am grateful for the offer, I am afraid I have enough travelling companions and have no need of any more. Sorry.~
@907  = ~I understand, <CHARNAME>. If you change your mind, however, she will be here.~
@908  = ~Very well. Now, to continue with the business at hand.~
@909  = ~I trust all that is settled? Now then. To continue with the business at hand.~
@910  = ~Well, that's a shame. I'll just have to send someone else along.~
@911  = ~Not to rush you or anything, <CHARNAME>, but you did promise to deliver those funds to my mother. She does tend to get slightly... touchy sometimes when she doesn't get what she's expecting, and I'd rather not have that happen.~
@912  = ~Yes, I'll get on with it as soon as possible.~
@913  = ~No, I've decided I don't have the time for this.~
@914  = ~Dreadful. Though somehow I think you already knew that would be the answer.~
@915  = ~Maybe I should answer that myself.~
@916  = ~(An unusual-looking elf with crimson hair emerges from the shadows. As she steps closer to you, you notice that her eyes are as red as her hair, and to your surprise, you see she has a tail. She glances at Aran, who nods, and then inclines her head to you, but she does not smile)~
@917  = ~Aran has recently charged me with uncovering all I can about this rival guild... and since he has charged you with the same task, I thought it prudent that we should join forces.~
@918  = ~I also saw the battle at Waukeen's Promenade... in fact, I was the only survivor from my guild. I saw the Cowled Wizards take your friend, something that I find... distasteful.~
@919  = ~So although my first loyalty is to Aran in bringing down our rivals, I would also like to help you recover your friend. I petitioned Aran to allow me to join you for these reasons. If you are willing to have me, of course.~
@920  = ~Fair enough, you may join. But I must tell you that although I am now bound to discover all I can about this rival guild, *my* first loyalty lies with rescuing my friend Imoen from the Cowled Wizards.~
@921  = ~Fair enough, you may join with me. But I must inform you that although I am working with Aran to uncover this rival guild, *my* first loyalty is to pursue the mage Irenicus and make him pay for all he has done to me.~
@922  = ~I am grateful for the offer, Fade, but I have enough travelling companions and have no wish for any more. Sorry.~
@923  = ~Although your insight into this rival guild may be useful, I cannot in good conscience allow a Shadow Thief into my party. It rankles me enough that I have to be involved in such shadowy dealings, and I do not wish to entrench myself in this organisation. I am sorry.~
@924  = ~I understand perfectly, <CHARNAME>. Just speak to me again once Aran is done briefing you. I will be ready to leave when you are.~
@925  = ~I understand, <CHARNAME>, and I wish you well. But if you do change your mind, you will find me here.~
@926  = ~I was there during the battle at Waukeen's Promenade, and I saw the Cowled Wizards take your friend. Let us say that I can sympathise with your situation, <CHARNAME>, and leave it at that.~
@927  = ~Aran has charged me with uncovering all I can about the rival guild, and since he has given you the same task, it makes sense that we join forces. So, what say you?~
@928  = ~Thank you for giving me the chance, <CHARNAME>. You will not be disappointed.~
@929  = ~But you must understand that although I am now bound to discover all I can about this rival guild, my first loyalty lies with rescuing my friend Imoen from the Cowled Wizards.~
@930  = ~But I must inform you that although I am working with Aran to uncover this rival guild, my main goal is to pursue the mage Irenicus and make him pay for all he has done to me.~
@931  = ~Halt! Who goes there?~
@932  = ~<CHARNAME> goes here! I have come for Fade!~
@933  = ~No one of consequence. Nice place you've got here, though your hospitality needs some work.~
@934  = ~I think you know exactly who I am and why I'm here. Now move aside or be moved.~
@935  = ~Fade? So you must be the Bhaalspawn keeper she keeps mentioning. Well, I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I'm only retrieving my master's property. It's all here, on this piece of parchment. She belongs to him, and there is nothing you can do about it.~
@936  = ~Wrong. I can kill you, for a start.~
@937  = ~Indeed? Then I'll buy her contract from you.~
@938  = ~You heartless bastard! Fade doesn't "belong" to anyone!~
@939  = ~Fair enough, although I think you should pay *me* for keeping hold of your property. Otherwise I could just kill you, take the merchandise, and sell her for a profit anyway.~
@940  = ~What? What do you mean? You come in here, slaughter my associates, and then comment on how *nice* it is in here? What do you really want?~
@941  = ~I think you know exactly why I'm here. Now step aside, or I'll be forced to teach you the same lesson I taught your "associates".~
@942  = ~What do I really want? Fade. NOW.~
@943  = ~Me? Nothing. I'll be going now.~
@944  = ~Good, and good riddance. Remember, this is private property. The next time you trespass here, I will not be so lenient.~
@945  = ~Fade abducted.

I encountered Mallon at a guarded compound in the Temple District, but chose not to press the issue of Fade. Fade's whereabouts are still unknown, and with Mallon gone, there is little chance I will ever see her again.~
@946  = ~Ahhh... so you must be the Bhaalspawn keeper the fiendling keeps mentioning. Well, I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I'm only retrieving my master's property. It's all here, on this piece of parchment. She belongs to him, and there is nothing you can do about it.~
@947  = ~You'd... buy her from me? How much are we talking here?~
@948  = ~500 gold. Anything to avoid a fight.~
@949  = ~1000 gold. I don't want to fight.~
@950  = ~2000 gold. She's worth it.~
@951  = ~No, I've changed my mind. I'm going to have to kill you to get her back.~
@952  = ~That's where you're wrong. If you take her from me, you're stealing from the Pasha... and he will not take too kindly to that.~
@953  = ~What if I buy her contract? Would that suffice?~
@954  = ~So be it! Prepare to die!~
@955  = ~(He eyes your weapons, and appears visibly discomfitted) All right. How much would it take for you to let me leave here with the fiendling, unchallenged?~
@956  = ~500 gold should do it.~
@957  = ~1000 gold should suffice.~
@958  = ~Nothing less than 2000 gold, I'm afraid.~
@959  = ~That's not enough, I'm afraid. You'll have to offer more than that.~
@960  = ~Okay, how about 1000 gold? I don't want to fight.~
@961  = ~Okay, how about 2000 gold? She's worth it.~
@962  = ~Sorry, I'm not prepared to offer more. I guess I'm going to have to kill you to get her back.~
@963  = ~No... I'm sorry. She's quite an exotic specimen, and the Pasha was very proud of having her in his collection. You'll have to offer more than that.~
@964  = ~Okay, how about 2000 gold? That's my final offer.~
@965  = ~2000 gold? Well, well. In that case... deal. She's yours.~
@966  = ~Fade abducted.

I encountered Mallon at a guarded compound in the Temple District. Apparently he had been hired by Fade's former master to track her down. I managed to bribe him off and he has now left. Fade should be somewhere in the room he was guarding.~
@967  = ~(grin) You have yourself a deal.~
@968  = ~Fade abducted.

I encountered Mallon at a guarded compound in the Temple District. Apparently he had been hired by Fade's former master to track her down. I managed to "persuade" him to part with some gold for the privilege of leaving the area unchallenged. He has now left, presumably with Fade still in his custody, and it is highly unlikely I will ever see either of them again.~
@969  = ~(He looks thoughtful for a moment, but then as you rest your hand on the hilt of your weapon, he nods) All right, you have yourself a deal. 1000 gold it is.~
@970  = ~No, I'm not going to pay that much!~
@971  = ~Then I guess I'm going to have to kill you and sell her myself.~
@972  = ~Okay then, how about 1000 gold?~
@973  = ~Hmmm... how about 500 gold?~
@974  = ~If it is a fight you want, a fight you'll get--and I'll see to it personally that it's your last!~
@975  = ~Fade abducted.

I encountered Mallon at a guarded compound in the Temple District. Apparently he had been hired by Fade's former master to track her down. Now that I have dispatched him, I should find Fade somewhere in the room he was guarding.~
@976  = ~Finally. Fade. It's been hard work tracking you down. You've quite lived up to your name... until lately, that is. Really, if you wanted to stay hidden, you shouldn't have taken up with such... highly visible company.~
@977  = ~You've been tracking me down? Who are you, and what do you want with me?~
@978  = ~Suffice to say that I am a retriever of other people's property. For a fee, of course. You did leave town rather abruptly the last time. I'm afraid that upset quite a few people.~
@979  = ~What? How did you--~
@980  = ~How did I find out? That's really not important. All you need to know is that I have been tasked with bringing you in.~
@981  = ~Now, will you cooperate, or shall we be forced to resort to... force?~
@982  = ~(chuckle) Tell her to make it the second one, Mallon... I like 'em with a bit of fight.~
@983  = ~Never! I'll never let you take me in! Never!~
@984  = ~I thought it might be something like that. Unfortunately, or fortunately in our case, the choice is not up to you.~
@985  = ~Off we go now, girlie.~
@986  = ~Let me go, you filthy-- <CHARNAME>, help me!~
@987  = ~Fade abducted.

Fade has been kidnapped, teleported away by a man called Mallon and his accomplices. The only clue to their location is a tattered piece of parchment one of the kidnappers dropped. From what I can make of the message, the Temple District would be the best place to start looking.~
@988  = ~I'm here to get Fade back, you slaving bastards!~
@989  = ~Ah. So, it is you. We wondered when you would turn up. No matter. You will be dealt with soon enough.~
@990  = ~I see the Shadow Master heard your petition then, Fade.~
@991  = ~(grin) Yes.~
@992  = ~Well, take care, kid. You know where I am if you... need me. Just yell.~
@993  = ~I will.~
@994  = ~You're back then... and in one piece!~
@995  = ~Were you expecting otherwise?~
@996  = ~From you? No. You've always had the luck of the damned. Are you... going to be staying?~
@997  = ~I don't know. Depends on what <CHARNAME> wants to do.~
@998  = ~Ahhh. <CHARNAME>.~
@999  = ~Sidge... don't be like that.~
@1000 = ~Well... are you staying?~
@1001 = ~<CHARNAME>?~
@1002 = ~No, I wasn't planning on it.~
@1003 = ~If you want. I've got nothing else planned.~
@1004 = ~I see. Fair enough.~
@1005 = ~(sigh)~
@1006 = ~What was that all about?~
@1007 = ~Sorry. I seem to have upset your boyfriend.~
@1008 = ~Well, if that's the case, might I... see you later?~
@1009 = ~I... didn't know you were seeing anyone, Fade.~
@1010 = ~Okay, what was that all about?~
@1011 = ~From you? No. You've always had the luck of the damned.~
@1012 = ~I just love pretty things... don't you think I'm pretty?  (giggle)~
@1013 = ~(snigger)~
@1014 = ~What are you laughing at, fiendling?~
@1015 = ~Nothing... nothing.~
@1016 = ~Well, make sure you aren't. I've had enough of you, sniffing round my Aran!~
@1017 = ~What? I've never... I'm not... how dare you! Aran is my boss, nothing more!~
@1018 = ~And I intend to make sure it stays that way! Now get out of my sight before I tell my sweetie that you've been upsetting me again.~
@1019 = ~Ah, there y'are, Fade. I was just wonderin' when ye were going to be givin' me back those things ye borrowed a while back? I don't mind y'borrowin' me stuff, but they were good Turmish steel, cost me a dragon's hoard... ~
@1020 = ~(blush) Shutupshutupshutupshutup!!~
@1021 = ~What's this all about then, Fade?~
@1022 = ~(spare Fade's blushes and say nothing)~
@1023 = ~Nothing.~
@1024 = ~Nothing? Didn't seem like nothing to me.~
@1025 = ~Okay, Fade. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.~
@1026 = ~He's not my boyfriend.~
@1027 = ~No? Then what is he?~
@1028 = ~Could have fooled me. That was a "spurned lover" look if I ever saw one.~
@1029 = ~Oh, well... that's good.~
@1030 = ~I'm not. Sidge is just a... friend.~
@1031 = ~Just a friend? He just invited you to "see him later". Added to that look he gave you, it seemed more than an invitation for a game of cards and a quiet drink to me.~
@1032 = ~How good a friend are we talking here?~
@1033 = ~Like I said, it's nothing. Sidge is just a... friend of mine.~
@1034 = ~Just a friend? You could have fooled me.~
@1035 = ~(sigh) I know you want to know, <CHARNAME>. You always say "you don't have to tell me... " and then hope I'll spill my guts anyway. Sidge is just a friend of mine. Nothing else.~
@1036 = ~He's... just a friend.~
@1037 = ~And what is that supposed to mean? Sidge is just a friend of mine. A... good friend, granted, but nothing more. Not that it has anything to do with you.~
@1038 = ~Nothing to do with me? While you're a part of my group, it has everything to do with me!~
@1039 = ~How "good" a friend are we talking here? A "five-times-a-night, -six-if-you-count-the-morning" kind of "good" friend?~
@1040 = ~So, do you have... feelings for him, then?~
@1041 = ~Good? What do you mean?~
@1042 = ~Nothing. Nothing at all.~
@1043 = ~Because it means I don't have to torture myself with... visions of you with him.~
@1044 = ~(She sighs angrily, her tail beginning to twitch) Yes, he's *just* a friend. A... good friend, granted, but nothing more. Not that it has anything to do with you anyway.~
@1045 = ~Good enough. (sigh) Why are you so insistent on knowing about me and Sidge anyway? Are you... jealous?~
@1046 = ~Yes!~
@1047 = ~No! Of course not!~
@1048 = ~No, I'm not. I just need to make sure that your attention is focused on our goals, and not on your "good friend" Sidge. That's all.~
@1049 = ~What's wrong with you, <CHARNAME>? You aren't... jealous, are you?~
@1050 = ~And what if he is?!~
@1051 = ~What? You're not joking, are you? Please tell me you're joking.~
@1052 = ~I knew it. So, do you have... feelings for him, then?~
@1053 = ~What? Feelings? <CHARNAME>... no. Sidge is a great guy and everything... but no, I don't have any feelings for him. We just have an arrangement. It suits... suited... us fine. He knows the score--we are there when we... need each other. Nothing else.~
@1054 = ~"When you need each other"? I hope that doesn't mean what I think it means.~
@1055 = ~So, if you met someone else, he'd understand that you wouldn't... "need" him anymore?~
@1056 = ~Oh no. You're not getting out of this that easily. What do you mean by "good"?~
@1057 = ~I said "nothing" and I mean "nothing"! Let's just drop this. Now.~
@1058 = ~Well, it means I don't have to torture myself with... visions of you two together.~
@1059 = ~All right, all right. You didn't mean *anything*. Fine. Got it.~
@1060 = ~(blush) Oh.~
@1061 = ~Oh? Except I will... won't I? Because he is the kind of "good friend" who keeps your sheets warm at night, isn't he?!~
@1062 = ~Oh? I see. Do you have... feelings for him, then?~
@1063 = ~You... are? Why? You have absolutely no reason to be jealous of Sidge.~
@1064 = ~Yes, I do.~
@1065 = ~I don't? Then why do you... see him?~
@1066 = ~So why all the fuss? If you're not bothered... ~
@1067 = ~Okay, okay, yes! I am jealous! Really jealous!~
@1068 = ~I'm not! So... will you be going to see your little Sidgie-widgie tonight, then?~
@1069 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>. All my attention is on our goals and not on Sidge. I am actually capable of walking, talking and thinking all at the same time, you know.~
@1070 = ~I'm not joking. Why is this eating at you so much? Are you jealous or something?~
@1071 = ~I... think you know it does. Why is this bothering you so much? Are you jealous or something?~
@1072 = ~Then I wouldn't see him anymore. Not like that, anyway. Like I said, he knows this. <CHARNAME>... you really don't have any reason to be jealous of him, you know.~
@1073 = ~Who said anything about being jealous? I didn't.~
@1074 = ~(She looks away from you, roses of colour tinting her cheeks) No, you don't. I mean it.~
@1075 = ~(She gives you a hesitant, but reassuringly warm smile, and self-consciously touches your arm) You really have absolutely nothing to worry about.~
@1076 = ~Because... sometimes a girl gets... urges, <CHARNAME>. Surely you can appreciate that?~
@1077 = ~"Urges"?! That's it? Why do you think the Gods invented hands, Fade?!~
@1078 = ~Yes, I can appreciate that. It doesn't mean I have to like it, though. But what if you met someone who could satisfy those... urges?~
@1079 = ~Don't be such an arse, <CHARNAME>! Just... get over yourself, okay? You have nothing, and I repeat, *nothing* to be jealous of. I had no intention of seeking Sidge's company today, so just let it be.~
@1080 = ~(She initially looks shocked, then angry, but despite herself, she then bursts out laughing) I'll have to remember that in the future, <CHARNAME>... ~
@1081 = ~(At that, you cannot help but laugh yourself. When your collective laughter eventually subsides, Fade grins, wiping tears from her cheeks)~
@1082 = ~No more jealousy, though, okay? I mean it. (she shakes a mock-admonishing finger at you and grins again)~
@1083 = ~Then I would have no need to see Sidge, would I? (wink)~
@1084 = ~It's nothing! Nothing at all!~
@1085 = ~Come now, girlie, y'can't be keepin' them for good. Tell ye what, if ye likes them that much, I'll get an extra set next time I--~
@1086 = ~Booter, PLEASE!~
@1087 = ~(grin) Awww, come off it. I can tell t'won't be long afore he's findin' out about it anyway.~
@1088 = ~(mutter) Please, let me die... ~
@1089 = ~I'll find out, will I? Well, I'm sure that's something to look forward to.~
@1090 = ~Hang on--before I find out about what?~
@1091 = ~(She glances quickly at you and then mutters something you don't quite catch to Booter)~
@1092 = ~Okay, I'll get 'em when I have a spare moment. Now you go off and have fun. (grin)~
@1093 = ~Oh, you can shut up too! (She mutters something to Booter you don't quite catch)~
@1094 = ~Ah, doan' be afraid. I'm sure she'd be gentle the firs' time, if you're not mmppffhh mmmfpphff mmmmm... ~
@1095 = ~(Still blushing furiously, she clamps her hand over Booter's mouth and mutters something to him you don't quite catch)~
@1096 = ~Okay, okay, I was jus' teasin'. I'll get 'em when I have a spare moment. Now you go off and have fun. (grin)~
@1097 = ~I don't know what you mean, sir. I won't compromise anything, I promise.~
@1098 = ~No? Then what if someone at Mae'Var's Guildhouse recognizes you? What if Mae'Var himself recognizes you?~
@1099 = ~I'll make sure he won't, sir. <CHARNAME> will be the focus of all the attention--<PRO_HESHE> will be doing most of the work. I'll stay at the back and keep my head down.~
@1100 = ~Make sure you do! You may be able to twist Aran round your little finger, but I can see through you, Fade. If this mission fails, I will know who to blame. Do I make myself clear?~
@1101 = ~Perfectly, *sir*.~
@1102 = ~Y-yes, sir, Renal, sir. I would like that very much.~
@1103 = ~Good show!~
@1104 = ~(gasp) <CHARNAME>, he's offering you the guild! You'd be a Guildmaster! That is indeed an honour!~
@1105 = ~And for once, Fade, you are absolutely correct. So, what say you, <CHARNAME>?~
@1106 = ~(grin) I suppose I'm going to have to call you 'boss' from now on, aren't I? Welcome to the Shadow Thieves!~
@1107 = ~(wink) I'm sure we'll have one hell of a time... ~
@1108 = ~I see Aran must have listened to you then, Fade? (sigh) I was hoping to get this done without any... complications, but obviously that is not going to be the case, is it?~
@1109 = ~And well done to you too, Fade. Maybe I have... underestimated you somewhat in the past. You have shown yourself true to your Guild and your Shadow Master. Maybe we can "bury the hatchet", as they say?~
@1110 = ~Who's there? I am but a little old lady, with nothing but a stale crust of bread, there's nothing here worth stealing... ~
@1111 = ~And what are you *still* doing in here? Come to rob a poor old lady, have you? Get out, or it's the poker for you!~
@1112 = ~Ooooh, yes. You're not one, are you? Because if you are, I've got a poker, you know! I'll see you off, you little devil, trying to peer into my bedroom at night, I've seen you!~
@1113 = ~No, I'm not a gnome. I'm a <PRO_RACE>.~
@1114 = ~Well, yes, I am a gnome.~
@1115 = ~Oh yes, my Aran has many people working for him now, even though I'm not too keen on his insistence on hirin' them small buggers, especially them gnomes.~
@1116 = ~You aren't a gnome, are you? Because if you are, I've got a poker, you know! I'll see you off, you little devil, trying to peer into my bedroom at night, I've seen you!~
@1117 = ~(The cake smells musty, and you're sure that there's more than cat hair clinging to it) There you go. You look like you could do with some fattening up, skinny thing that y'are... ~
@1118 = ~Th-thank you, Mrs. Linvail. (look imploringly at Fade)~
@1119 = ~(set the plate firmly down on the table) Well, it's been lovely chatting to you, Mrs. Linvail, but we should be going now. Shouldn't we, Fade?~
@1120 = ~(pick something indescribable off the cake) Ack! What *is* this?~
@1121 = ~Of course you care for cake! Everyone cares for cake--it's full of... of cakey goodness, young <PRO_MANWOMAN>! Now eat up!~
@1122 = ~Yes, Mrs. Linvail, of course, Mrs. Linvail. Anything you say! (pretend to take a bite)~
@1123 = ~Uh, okay. (nibble an edge to show willing)~
@1124 = ~No, Mrs. Linvail, I'd rather not. Watching my weight, and all that.~
@1125 = ~Hello, Mrs. Linvail! I've come to drop some money off to you, from your son.~
@1126 = ~Aran? My Aran is here? No, always too busy to come and see his mother, always busy working, making a profit, who would have thought buying and selling used carts could take up so much time that you can't even visit your old mum once in a while, I ask you!~
@1127 = ~And me, an old woman, all here by myself, you never know what might happen, I might be ravished by gnomes in my bed, well, you do hear stories, don't you? Would you like a cup of tea?~
@1128 = ~Buying and selling... what? But Aran is the--~
@1129 = ~Er, yes, I would like some tea, Mrs. Linvail.~
@1130 = ~Ravished by gnomes?~
@1131 = ~(Fade stamps hard on your foot) Shutupshutupshutup... ~
@1132 = ~Aran's mother doesn't know Aran is a Shadow Thief! She thinks he's a merchant, and she would get rather... upset if she knew her son was a thief. She wanted him to be a knight, you see.~
@1133 = ~Ah, Mrs. Linvail! Ummmm... thank you for the tea.~
@1134 = ~Well, young lady, you I recognize. But *you*... are you new?~
@1135 = ~Yes, I'm the new delivery <PRO_GIRLBOY>.~
@1136 = ~No, I'm just a friend of Fade's.~
@1137 = ~Now you just stay put, I'll have tea ready in a minute... ~
@1138 = ~I forgot to tell you outside--Aran's mother doesn't know he's a Shadow Thief! She thinks he's a merchant, and she would get rather... upset if she knew her son was a thief. She wanted him to be a knight, you see.~
@1139 = ~And what is wrong with being a gnome? I come from a long line of distinguished gnomes, everyone of us an enterprising gentleman (or gentlewoman, of course). A woman of your... social stature and... respectability would have no problem from us humble gnomes. Why, even Cousin--~
@1140 = ~A gnome! In my house! I ask you, is nothing sacred? Now you listen to me, you little devil, if you step one foot closer to me, you'll feel the back of my hand, do I make myself clear? This is a respectable house, where only respectable things happen, and I don't need the likes of you coming in here, swaggering around, fingering my curtains and trying to sell me something!~
@1141 = ~I know the truth! Mother Gammage from up the road, it happened to her, woke up in the middle of the night and there were *hundreds* of the evil little buggers in her room, all of them trying to get under the bedclothes!~
@1142 = ~But Mrs. Linvail, Mother Gammage thinks she's a teapot half the time... ~
@1143 = ~Oooooooooh! Don't you cheek me, girl! I know you're not much better, you and your strange elven ways. I mean, what normal girl has *that* protruding from her bottom? I know what you're up to too!~
@1144 = ~(She turns to you and begins to speak in what she obviously thinks is a conspiratorial whisper, but it's obvious the whole room can hear her) If you ask me, I think there's something odd about her. You hear tales, don't you? Of... unholy rites and of demons and devils, doin' things with them weird priestesses in foreign parts... ~
@1145 = ~Er, yes, you do.~
@1146 = ~I wouldn't know, Mrs. Linvail. I'm obviously not as well informed as you on such matters.~
@1147 = ~I don't think you should be rude to Fade, Mrs. Linvail.~
@1148 = ~A friend? Hmmmm... have you known her long? My Aran sent her along last time with my money. My Aran is a good boy, looking after his mother in her old age. Still, I wish he'd gone off and joined up with those nice boys at the Radiant Heart, they are very kind to their mothers and don't just send money, they visit them too, oh yes!~
@1149 = ~Quite why my boy had to be a merchant, I don't know. "Aran," I said, "go and join up with those nice Radiant Heart boys, they'll look after you." But no, he had to listen to his father, maythegodsresthissoul. "Do what you like, son."... tsk tsk. If'n he had listened to his mother, like a *good* boy, he would be Prelate by now, you mark my words!~
@1150 = ~Come on, drink up and I'll get you cake.~
@1151 = ~(mutter) Just nod, smile and be nice and we might get out of here before the end of the tenday.~
@1152 = ~What the hell is she going on about?~
@1153 = ~I don't know. I never know. We'll make a break for it soon.~
@1154 = ~Here you go, a nice bit of cake. Don't worry about the hairs, the cat was asleep on it, just blow on them and they'll come right off. Eat up now!~
@1155 = ~Uh, thank you. (pretend to take a bite)~
@1156 = ~Oh, thank you very much. (nibble an edge to show willing)~
@1157 = ~No thanks. I don't really care for cake.~
@1158 = ~Well, that's comforting, even if you do sound like one of them inbred northerners. Are you one of those inbred northerners? Heathens, the lot of them. I hears that they drink the blood o' their enemies and paint themselves blue before going into battle, have you ever done that?~
@1159 = ~No, I'm sure you haven't. You're a bit young and if you're with my Aran, you're a good <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Come on, drink up and I'll get you cake.~
@1160 = ~An elf? Oooooh, I can't be havin' with elves, eating daisies and huggin' trees, never knowing a good days work in their lives and running off, stealing our women away... why do they do that? Aren't theirs any good? Their bloody men look like women anyway.~
@1161 = ~Well, drink up and I'll get you some cake. S'pose you'd like that, even if you *are* one o' them elves.~
@1162 = ~Ooooh, so you're a mix n' match, are you? Don't trust half-elves, they always look like they are up to something... are you up to something? Not as bad as them gnomes, filthy little bastards that *they* are, stealing my drawers from the washing line, but you never can tell with half elves, not quite one, and not quite the other. Why can't these human girls just find themselves a nice *human* husband, like my Aran, he would be good, never married you know.~
@1163 = ~Oh, I know that sometimes our men get tempted by those elven wenches, it's what you get for running around in see through dresses all day long, flighty things that they are, that's the elf-girls, not the men, no self-respecting man would run around in a see through dress, although I do worry about Mr. Beesworth from number 36 sometimes.~
@1164 = ~Well, drink up and I'll get you some cake.~
@1165 = ~Oooh, Aran sends along so many strangers to my door, he's sent a half-orc before, you know! I don't hold with that, no I don't, I wouldn't trust 'em as far as I could throw 'em. I got the bugger a good crack on the head before he could burn the house down, I know what your type are like, they burn things. And then they pillage. Ooooooh, the stories I've heard... ~
@1166 = ~Still, you can't be all that bad if you're with Aran, so drink up and I'll get you some cake.~
@1167 = ~A dwarf, eh? Clever little buggers, aren't you? Where's your axe, then? All dwarves got to have an axe, that and a beard you could hide a badger in. So, what mine did you leave? I know you all come from mines, don't like to trust those who feel more underground than over it, always singing bloody songs about gold, I see plenty 'em drunk in the bloody streets, so I do, it's all that quaffing you do, isn't it?~
@1168 = ~Well, not you personally, o' course. Come on, drink up and I'll get you some cake.~
@1169 = ~I do not hold with halflings in this house! No I don't! Not as bad as those little randy buggers... gnomes... but them halflings'll nick anything that's not tied down, and give the tied down stuff a good go at just in case! My Aran sent along this gaggle of halflings once to give me my money, it was two gold short! Thieving little bastards!~
@1170 = ~Will I need to count this out, young <PRO_MANWOMAN>? I hope not, because if I find out this is short, you'll feel the back of my hand, so you shall! Well, drink up and I'll get you some cake, I know you people like your cake.~
@1171 = ~Why don't you like gnomes, Mrs. Linvail?~
@1172 = ~You see! <PRO_HESHE> agrees with me. Something's not quite right about you, girl, not sure I like my Aran messing with the types of you, I *warned* him I did, but does he ever listen to his mother? No, he doesn't... sending gnomes and girls with tails round to my house, oh, I don't know how my poor heart stands it sometimes... ~
@1173 = ~(through gritted teeth) Well, Mrs. Linvail, here's your money. It's been a pleasure, as usual, but we have to go now, don't we, <CHARNAME>?~
@1174 = ~Uh, yes. Things to do, people to meet, crazy old women to avoid... ~
@1175 = ~Oh, Fade, we've got plenty of time. I'm sure Mrs. Linvail would love a bit of company for a while.~
@1176 = ~Ah, well, young'un, you haven't been around as long as I have... ~
@1177 = ~(mutter) More's the pity.~
@1178 = ~... but I've been told tales, it's a heathen world outside the walls of Athkatla--folk aren't the same, you know, indulging in ungodly rites and eatin' spicy food, it's all bad for you. What you need is a nice piece of my cake, at least *that's* wholesome food, none of this foreign rubbish, you mark my words, it's what makes my Aran take in the likes of her.~
@1179 = ~What? Foreign food makes Aran employ Fade?~
@1180 = ~Oh, the CHEEK of it all! Here I am, and old woman what is growing deaf, with my poor, poor heart, and this young upstart here tells me what I can and can't say!~
@1181 = ~I can't believe my Aran sends this... this... *scarlet* woman to my house, her with a tail and all, it can't be natural, I tell you! And you know what they say about thems with red hair, don't you... ~
@1182 = ~Now that's unfair, Mrs. Linvail!~
@1183 = ~(sniff) You can go and protest your innocence elsewhere, young lady! Just give me my gold and be off with you! You and that... swaggering behind of yours.~
@1184 = ~Fine! Here's your gold... (mutter) you old bag... ~
@1185 = ~I heard that!~
@1186 = ~Good-*bye*, Mrs. Linvail!~
@1187 = ~(The cake tastes awful--you now have a mouthful of cat hair and possibly something else less pleasant) There you go. You look like you could do with some fattening up, skinny thing that y'are... ~
@1188 = ~(whisper) You *ate* it? Oh, you're going to be so sick now.~
@1189 = ~L-lovely. Thank you, Mrs. Linvail.~
@1190 = ~(pick something indescribable out of your mouth) Ack! What *is* this?~
@1191 = ~Because I know the truth! Dirty little beggars they are, only one thing on their minds. You can tell by the size of their noses--no woman of class is safe in their beds! Stealing my bloomers and hiding behind doors--if I had a daughter, I'd lock her up, just in case!~
@1192 = ~But I've never met a gnome who'd ever--~
@1193 = ~I said women of *class*, you little harlot! Not one with a tail!~
@1194 = ~Aran's "delicate errand".

Fade and I have delivered the money to Aran's mother, and mercifully managed to leave the house with a whole skin. Hopefully the Shadow Master will not require the same type of task from me any time in the foreseeable future.~
@1195 = ~Well, where's my gold, then?~
@1196 = ~It's here, Mrs. Linvail. I'll just leave it here on the table.~
@1197 = ~And I'll be counting it! Twice, just to make sure!~
@1198 = ~Fine! Good-*bye*, Mrs. Linvail!~
@1199 = ~(mutter) I hate you sometimes.~
@1200 = ~Well, that's nice. Here, have some cake. Don't worry about the hairs, the cat was asleep on it, just blow on them and they'll come right off. Eat up now!~
@1201 = ~Are you simple or something? No! Foreign things do! Because she's obviously foreign. Not a good, decent Athkatla girl, that one... good Athkatla girls don't come with tails!~
@1202 = ~Oooh, you are most welcome, dear! And I can see you are enjoying that, just by the look on your face! Would you like some to take home?~
@1203 = ~NO! I mean... we're not going home, Mrs. Linvail, we've got work to do. We really should be going now.~
@1204 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>. We should be going!~
@1205 = ~It's good for you! Extra protein, builds strong bones and healthy... healthy skin, or something like that. Don't question me! Just eat up!~
@1206 = ~No, Mrs. Linvail. I think we should be going now.~
@1207 = ~Oh, so soon? Well, where's my gold then? Don't think I've forgotten, because I haven't!~
@1208 = ~A skinny thing like you, watching your weight? I don't believe it! Go on, eat it up! It's good for you!~
@1209 = ~Where is Fade? What have you done to her?~
@1210 = ~My companion, Fade.~
@1211 = ~And to prove I am serious, I will take something dear to you. I believe you have formed an "attachment" to the fiendling--one who knows only too intimately the struggle of fighting her instincts.~
@1212 = ~Oh, I seriously doubt that.~
@1213 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Fade.  Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of the one I love is at stake, as well!~
@1214 = ~You lay a finger on me or <CHARNAME>, bitch, and you'll regret it.~
@1215 = ~Then let us tarry no longer and rid these catacombs of vampires forever!~
@1216 = ~I don't care! I just want to help Imoen and get Fade back!~
@1217 = ~(ignore Drizzt and stride onwards to rescue Fade)~
@1218 = ~Well said! I will fight at your side in this, <CHARNAME>.~
@1219 = ~I know... I have heard what happened. We shall fight onwards together, and pray that your beloved is unharmed.~
@1220 = ~I feel your pain, my friend, but please exercise caution. You have to face the very real fact that your love may not be what she once was. We shall fight together to retrieve her, though.~
@1221 = ~(For a fleeting moment, a flicker of uncertainty flits across her eyes. She gestures to a still form lying close by) Your fiendling? She is here... ~
@1222 = ~You bitch! If you've killed her... ~
@1223 = ~What... what have you done? Fade... please, please get up!~
@1224 = ~(try to go to her) No! Fade... my love... please... ~
@1225 = ~Oh, she is not dead. It seems vampirism affects those of an infernal heritage differently from others. She seems to have fallen into some kind of slumber that we cannot wake her from... and I look forward to see what she emerges as when she awakens.~
@1226 = ~You "look forward" to it, do you? So why do I see fear in your eyes?~
@1227 = ~You didn't even know this would happen, did you? You thought she'd turn to your side willingly... but she hasn't, has she? Not only have you taken her from me, but *you* can't use her either!~
@1228 = ~What do you mean, "emerge"? What the hell have you done to her?~
@1229 = ~She can't hear you, <CHARNAME>. She is in some kind of... trance. It seems vampirism affects those of an infernal heritage differently from others. She seems to have fallen into some kind of slumber that we cannot wake her from... and I look forward to see what she emerges as when she awakens.~
@1230 = ~I think that is close enough. She isn't dead. It seems vampirism affects those of an infernal heritage differently from others. She seems to have fallen in to some kind of slumber that we cannot wake her from... and I look forward to see what she emerges as when she awakens.~
@1231 = ~ENOUGH! When she emerges, *you* will no longer be able to satisfy her... she *will* turn to our ways! She has no choice.~
@1232 = ~(draw your weapon) Oh, there's always a choice, Bodhi. There is ALWAYS a choice.~
@1233 = ~She won't turn to you! I will stop you, I *will* get Fade back and I *will* restore Imoen! That's a promise, Bodhi!~
@1234 = ~(laugh) I doubt that, <CHARNAME>. To my knowledge, there has never been an instance where those with demonic blood have been exposed to vampirism. Who knows what she will emerge as? I do know, however, that you will no longer be able to satisfy her... she *will* turn to our ways! She has no choice.~
@1235 = ~Oh, do not fear, <CHARNAME>. I look forward to seeing what product the mingling of vampiric and Tan'ari blood will be. Who knows what she will emerge as? All I do know, however, is that you will no longer be able to satisfy her... she *will* turn to our ways! She has no choice.~
@1236 = ~I suppose we both knew it would end this way. I *will* keep this soul, and I *will* have Fade! Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. I would say it has been a pleasure... ~
@1237 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi has turned Fade into a vampire! Or... or very nearly. The fact of her demonic blood appears to have disrupted the process somewhat, and she now lies in a trance. Bodhi suggested that when she awakens, she may have... transformed into something else altogether. Hopefully something can be done, or I will have lost her.~
@1238 = ~Your pathetic boastings do not frighten me, <CHARNAME>. Imoen's soul is *mine*, as is your love, Fade! Maybe I will keep you alive, just so you can see what she emerges as... and then I will let her devour you!~
@1239 = ~But Fade... Oh, I'm so sorry, <CHARNAME>. Maybe there will be clues here as to how to restore her... let us look.~
@1240 = ~(Fade's eyes flutter open and your heart leaps, only to sink further as she looks hungrily around herself, not taking any notice of you at all. Standing up, she seems to grow before your very eyes; as if from the ether a pair of wings materialize, her fingers are replaced with cruel talons, and her features twist into a cruel parody of her former fair countenance)~
@1241 = ~Haha! Free!~
@1242 = ~Fade? What has happened to you?~
@1243 = ~No, you're not Fade! You're... something else.~
@1244 = ~You think I am your fiendling plaything? No... but she is here... she cowers away from me. The stupid vampire weakened that part of the creature you call "Fade" and so allowed me to dominate this shell.~
@1245 = ~So that is what Bodhi meant by "emerging". I shall slay you, demon, and bring Fade back!~
@1246 = ~Fade! I know you are in there. Please answer me... please... I love you... ~
@1247 = ~You shall not inhabit her "shell" for much longer, demon! I shall beat you out of it!~
@1248 = ~Oh, she's here... she cowers from me, from what she once was. Once she embraced our ways! I guided her steps, and then she abandoned us and sent me back to rot in the Abyss.~
@1249 = ~But now I am back, stronger then ever! The stupid vampire weakened that part of the creature you call "Fade" and so allowed me to dominate this shell.~
@1250 = ~Slay me? But we are too closely entwined, your "love" and I... slay me and you slay her!~
@1251 = ~No! That isn't true! I shall beat you and bring her back!~
@1252 = ~Wh-what are you saying?~
@1253 = ~(laugh) Oh... how touching. She can't hear you, <CHARNAME>--too much does she fear me!~
@1254 = ~Then I shall have to slay you, demon, and bring her back!~
@1255 = ~I will not allow you to inhabit her, demon! I shall beat you out of her!~
@1256 = ~Beat? You would beat this shell, the body of the one you love? We are too closely entwined, your "love" and I... slay me and you slay her!~
@1257 = ~So be it!~
@1258 = ~We are one! Let us see how far you will go to rescue her... ~
@1259 = ~<CHARNAME>... not dead... still here, but weakened... priest... (she passes out)~
@1260 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi's attempt at turning Fade weakened her hold over body and soul enough to allow a demon to take possession. I defeated the demon, but it still inhabits Fade's body, and she is growing weaker by the minute. Perhaps those who have knowledge of how to deal with vampirism also know something of how to solve this.~
@1261 = ~(Fade lies unconscious, and her breathing is dangerously shallow)~
@1262 = ~It is as I feared. She is gone. There is nothing more I can do. You made your choice, and while the demon is no longer here, the girl's spirit went with it.~
@1263 = ~I... see. You did your best. I must... go now.~
@1264 = ~Fade! NO! You killed her! Bring her back to me, now!~
@1265 = ~Are you ready?~
@1266 = ~No, I have had second thoughts. Banish the creature--I do not wish to fight it.~
@1267 = ~Have you found the weapon you need?~
@1268 = ~I have the tooth of a red dragon here. Will that do?~
@1269 = ~No, not yet. I will continue looking.~
@1270 = ~Back so soon, my son? What is wrong?~
@1271 = ~It didn't work! Fade is still inhabited by some kind of demonic force. I... I don't know what to do. Please help me!~
@1272 = ~I think I have reversed the vampirism, but it turns out that was the least of our worries. A demonic spirit seems to have taken up residence in Fade's consciousness, and although I have beaten it back for the moment, I don't know how to get rid of it for good.~
@1273 = ~This isn't Fade, it's some kind of demon-spirit. We have to send it back to where it came from!~
@1274 = ~You seem troubled, my son. Can I help you?~
@1275 = ~I hope so. My love, Fade, has been inhabited by some kind of demonic force. I... I don't know how to get rid of it. Please help me!~
@1276 = ~It is complicated. My love, Fade, was exposed to vampirism. I think that has been reversed, but it turns out that was the least of my worries. A demonic spirit seems to have taken up residence in Fade's consciousness, and although I have beaten it back for the moment, I don't know how to get rid of it for good.~
@1277 = ~My love, Fade, was exposed to vampirism. I have reversed that, but it still isn't Fade, it's some kind of demon-spirit! We have to send it back to where it came from!~
@1278 = ~Please, calm down. Lay the young lady here. Yes... possession. You have a very difficult choice ahead of you now.~
@1279 = ~I see... but it is good that you have kept your head. She has indeed been possessed, which means you have a very difficult choice ahead of you now.~
@1280 = ~Indeed, we do. Please, lay the young lady here. Yes... possession. You have a very difficult choice ahead of you now.~
@1281 = ~I can do one of two things. Firstly, I can banish the spirit now, but with that there is the very real risk that her spirit will be too closely entwined with that of the demon's, meaning she will be banished too, forever.~
@1282 = ~Secondly, you can fight and kill the demon, which will banish it from this plane, hopefully leaving your love's spirit here. Both have huge implications, for you, and for the girl.~
@1283 = ~So, I can banish the demon-spirit, but also risk banishing Fade? Then I will take that risk. Banish the creature.~
@1284 = ~But I have fought the demon, and it is still here!~
@1285 = ~But with both choices, I run the risk of losing Fade! Which one has the greater risk?~
@1286 = ~Then I will fight the creature again... but I do not know how to kill it.~
@1287 = ~Before we continue, there is something I should tell you about Fade. She is a Fey'ri--a part-demon--herself. I think that is how the spirit managed to inhabit her in the first place.~
@1288 = ~Banishment? Are you sure? The demon will hold on to her as closely as possible.~
@1289 = ~No... do it. No matter what happens, the demon must not be allowed to survive.~
@1290 = ~Then the risk is too great. I will fight the creature again, but I must know how to kill it.~
@1291 = ~That is because your normal weapons will not be able to deliver a killing blow--they are not powerful enough. You need a powerful artifact to slay the demon.~
@1292 = ~Something... some part of a powerful creature, a tooth or a claw that might be fashioned into a weapon--that may work. A devil, or a great Wyrm... ~
@1293 = ~I see. I shall go and find what you need. Please take care of Fade in my absence.~
@1294 = ~No, this is too hard. Banish the demon and be done with it!~
@1295 = ~They both have their risks, but if the demon is too closely entangled with your friend, then she will be banished too. Fighting the demon is the harder choice for you, but it will separate the two of them, meaning that I will be able to banish only the demon. The choice is, as I said, yours.~
@1296 = ~Then the choice is clear. I will fight the creature again, but I do not know how to kill it.~
@1297 = ~Yes, I feel that is the safest way to get your love back. Normal weapons will not be able to deliver a killing blow--they are not powerful enough. You need a powerful artifact to slay the demon.~
@1298 = ~I... see. Yes, that would make things easier for the spirit. While I would question your love for such a... woman, I will say that simply banishing the spirit would almost certainly result in the banishment of Fade--the spell would not differentiate between the two.~
@1299 = ~Fighting the demon is the harder choice for you, but it will separate the two of them, meaning that I will be able to banish only the demon. The choice is, as I said, yours.~
@1300 = ~As you wish.~
@1301 = ~That is perfect. Hopefully this should work. I will call the demon, and as soon as it is weakened, you will plunge the tooth into its heart. I will then perform the banishing ritual.~
@1302 = ~This should mean the demon will leave the girl--and leave her spirit with us. I just hope your bond with her is strong enough. Are you ready?~
@1303 = ~No, wait a moment, I need to prepare myself.~
@1304 = ~That I shall... but do not take too long! I have heard rumours of an ancient Red Dragon which makes its lair in the Windspear Hills--perhaps you might begin your search there. Good luck.~
@1305 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

In order to defeat the demon for good, I need a claw or tooth from some powerful creature--a devil or a dragon. The priest of Oghma has advised me to search for a Red Dragon rumoured to make its lair in the Windspear Hills.~
@1306 = ~I am... sorry for your loss.~
@1307 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi

The demon has been destroyed, but I have paid a high price. Fade has been banished along with it.~
@1308 = ~I warned you of the dangers! Take some comfort that the demon-spirit is also gone. Her sacrifice was not in vain. I am... sorry for your loss, but there is nothing I can do.~
@1309 = ~Yes. Come and speak to me when you are ready.~
@1310 = ~(Mortally wounded, the demon roars in pain)~
@1311 = ~Now! Use the tooth!~
@1312 = ~(You plunge the tooth deep into the demon's heart. The demon-spirit screams and part of you is horrified to hear that it sounds like Fade, only amplified a hundred times)~
@1313 = ~Hirelings? I am no such thing, rich kid, and don't you forget it!~
@1314 = ~No, I didn't mean it like that! I meant--~
@1315 = ~I know damn well what you meant, Nalia. And I for one do not take kindly to the inference.~
@1316 = ~You agreed to help me and my cause the minute <CHARNAME> did, Fade. Please remember that. As I said before, Daleson, keep no secrets.~
@1317 = ~Lessers? Why, you stuck-up old bitch! Just give me one good reason why I shouldn't fu-- mmmpphhhfff mmmppphhhf!~
@1318 = ~Uh, sorry. She doesn't mean what she's saying.~
@1319 = ~Fade, that's not helpful.~
@1320 = ~Please ignore my friend here, my Lady. She is a little overwrought.~
@1321 = ~Hooligans? We're here to rescue you, you stuck-up old bitch! Go on, just give me one good reason why I shouldn't fu-- mmmpphhhfff mmmppphhhf!~
@1322 = ~With pleasure.~
@1323 = ~There, that'll teach her!~
@1324 = ~What did you do that for? I know she's unpleasant, but you didn't have to punch her!~
@1325 = ~Nice right hook! Now we just have to come up with a reason as to *why* she is unconscious.~
@1326 = ~Gods, Fade--where did you learn to throw a punch like that?~
@1327 = ~Nalia, shut up. Unless you want some of the same, of course.~
@1328 = ~Oh, I think I did, <CHARNAME>... I think I did.~
@1329 = ~Troll did it. Nasty things, trolls.~
@1330 = ~You don't live by the Docks without learning a few tricks, <CHARNAME>. (grin)~
@1331 = ~Overwrought? I'm not overwrought! I am absolutely bloody disgusted, that's what I am! How *dare* this... this woman speak to us like this, after we've come here to help her?~
@1332 = ~How dare *I* speak in such a way? That is my BIRTHRIGHT, you stupid little scrubber! Who are *you* to question that?~
@1333 = ~Nalia, I shudder to think about you mixing with such a foul and insolent wretch!~
@1334 = ~Well, you're entitled to your opinion, I suppose, but we really have to get you out of here. Let's move on. NOW.~
@1335 = ~I'm sorry? My friend here may be a little... undiplomatic at times, but that gives you no cause to insult her like that. She is here, as are the rest of us, to save your skin, so I think you should show a little respect!~
@1336 = ~You evil-minded witch. Fade--she's all yours.~
@1337 = ~I shudder to even *think* about Nalia mixing with such a foul and insolent wretch!~
@1338 = ~Well, you're entitled to your opinion, I suppose, but we really have to get you out of here. Please keep quiet, there are still those around who would do you harm.~
@1339 = ~(shudder) What a despicable creature.~
@1340 = ~Well, at least one of you knows how to show proper respect to their betters. Who is this despicable creature?~
@1341 = ~Respect? What are you blathering on about? I am the Lady here, and so I am the one who should be demanding respect! You should be honoured to serve me in this way!~
@1342 = ~Y-you hit her--you actually hit her! How could you?! I mean, I know she can be pretty insufferable, but... but how dare you strike her! She is the noble of this house, and--~
@1343 = ~The paladin is right. We must work to stop this evil trade.~
@1344 = ~I must admit, I never thought I would hear that sentiment from you. What makes you say such a thing?~
@1345 = ~We all have our reasons, Keldorn. No one has the right to own another person.~
@1346 = ~Slavery is disgusting enough when it involves adults, but children, too? That is indeed despicable. Is there no depth these people are unwilling to stoop to? <CHARNAME>, we have to put a stop to this, once and for all.~
@1347 = ~<CHARNAME>! How can you say that? We must help these people!~
@1348 = ~If you ever need our help again, we... I... would be more than happy to fight at your side. Please do not forget that.~
@1349 = ~No, calm yourself, we're not here to hurt you. The way is clear... you're free!~
@1350 = ~If we hadn't rescued you, death would have been preferable compared to the other things such men are capable of.~
@1351 = ~Because some people are just evil bastards. It's a power thing--they think they can treat people, even children, like puppets, making them perform for their own twisted pleasure. (shudder) Just try to hold on to the fact that we saved that one little girl; we gave that little a girl a chance to live a normal life.~
@1352 = ~Jaheira is right--giving her something to live was the least we could do.~
@1353 = ~I'm glad you helped that poor little thing, although I cannot help but wonder if she will still have that gold by sunset. I wish there was more we could do.~
@1354 = ~Slaving bastards! I'll gut the lot of you like the pigs you are!~
@1355 = ~Well, well, well, what do we have here? Incandescent beauty, you have set my heart aflame!~
@1356 = ~What? You being funny or something?~
@1357 = ~Never, O beauteous phoenix... just a chance to nestle for one night within your fiery embrace is all I can ask!~
@1358 = ~Are you for real?~
@1359 = ~Ummmm... yes... nestling... err... Aha! My smoldering lovely, I burn with a passion surpassing all others!~
@1360 = ~And?~
@1361 = ~Err... that's it.~
@1362 = ~So what you are saying, in essence, is you fancy a quickie?~
@1363 = ~Umm... possibly?~
@1364 = ~(She grins slowly, making sure Salvanas gets a good look at her slightly-more-pointed than could be considered the norm canines and flicks her tail at him)~
@1365 = ~(gulp) What was that?~
@1366 = ~(grin) My tail.~
@1367 = ~Tail? So you're a... ~
@1368 = ~Yes, I'm a tiefling. A Fey'ri tiefling--a part-succubus, to be more precise.~
@1369 = ~Really?! Well! It's been nice chatting with you, nice demon lady, but now I have to... I have to... ummm... well, go, really.~
@1370 = ~And the succubus returns! Still do I yearn for you. (quietly) Even though you do kind of scare me a bit... ~
@1371 = ~(sigh) Not you again.~
@1372 = ~Oh, you wound me, my fiery temptress! All I ask is to be able to caress those flaming locks... to warm my skin against yours... to part your no doubt scorching curtains... ~
@1373 = ~OI!! Wannabe Romeo! If anyone is going to be parting her curtains, scorching or not, it'll be me, okay?? Just wanted to make that absolutely clear!~
@1374 = ~Oh dear, oh dear. Well, just remember to clean the bits up after you've finished this time, Fade.~
@1375 = ~Excuse me, but I don't really appreciate you speaking to my girlfriend like that, and I would just like to take this opportunity to say that if you continue to speak to her like this, I'm going to rip your arms off. Okay?~
@1376 = ~(gulp) Bits?~
@1377 = ~Oh, I just get, you know, a little overenthusiastic sometimes.~
@1378 = ~You... do? My, my, is that the time? Nice chatting to you, but I must go now! Uh... bye!~
@1379 = ~Oh... what? Umm... I wasn't being serious, I was just, well... look, please don't hurt me! I'm leaving!~
@1380 = ~Okay, message received loud and clear! I'll just go elsewhere, yes? Yes. That seems the best idea... ~
@1381 = ~This is the training run for the Shadow Thieves, my friend. My domain. And I don't think I have seen *you* around here much lately, missy!~
@1382 = ~What, me? Oh, I'm here all the time, you just, err, can't... see... me.~
@1383 = ~Don't lie to me, girl. I know you haven't been here in a long time. I don't care how good you think you are, it still pays to practice on the run now and again!~
@1384 = ~(sigh) Yes, Pelanna. I'll do it as soon as I return from my mis--~
@1385 = ~Oh, no. You're going to run it NOW. Aran may have granted you a little play time to pursue other things, but *I* still expect you to practice!~
@1386 = ~Play time?? Aran has asked me to case the other guild!~
@1387 = ~Yes, I know. But I am also fully aware that gallivanting around the countryside with the likes of <PRO_HIMHER> is less of a chore than training with me. Now get to the run before you feel the flat of my sword!~
@1388 = ~(sigh) Yes, Pelanna.~
@1389 = ~(grin) Yeah, you wish! Best *dockside* crawler, more like.~
@1390 = ~Cheeky wench! Ye gotta watch this one, s'sharp she'll cut herself one o' these days. (grin) Yer off then? Well, good luck and all that. Don't really envy ye, but ye'll do a grand job, I'm sure.~
@1391 = ~Hmmm. Not bad. I expect better next time. You can go now.~
@1392 = ~There, all done. Are you satisfied?~
@1393 = ~(Fade pales considerably, her lips a thin, tight line) We have to stop this, <CHARNAME>. It's beyond monstrous.~
@1394 = ~You do not need to beg, my friend. Such activities as I have seen here sicken me beyond belief. We will free you and help you in any way we can.~
@1395 = ~As far as I am concerned, you can take your offer and shove it right up your ar--~
@1396 = ~FADE!!~
@1397 = ~(ahem) I mean you can jolly well take your offer and push off!~
@1398 = ~Hey, I thought I told you not to come back in here, thief! Aran knows the rules--no Shadow Thieves casing this place!~
@1399 = ~Hello, Ribald! Lovely to see you again. And I see you are still harping on about that little faux pas I made... how long ago? Oh, about three years now, isn't it?~
@1400 = ~Maybe so, but that's not the point!~
@1401 = ~(sigh) Come on, how many times do I have to tell you that I am not about to rob you blind? I made a mistake, and for the last time, I am sorry!  Now, can we please put it behind us? I think <CHARNAME> wants to buy something.~
@1402 = ~Ahhh... and I see ye've got the tailed lass with ye. How y'doin', Fade?~
@1403 = ~I'm doing well, Thumb. And yourself?~
@1404 = ~All the better fer seein' you, my little sweet one. Now, will y'be havin' the usual?~
@1405 = ~No, you'd better ask <CHARNAME>... <PRO_HESHE> is running the show now.~
@1406 = ~You must avenge her, Anomen. If you do not, no one else will.~
@1407 = ~Oh, go on, <CHARNAME>. You're only young once.~
@1408 = ~Should have known... dragons bear the best grudges. (whisper) And have the best loot.~
@1409 = ~Is that all you care about? We stand before a Wyrm of the Dread Flame, and all you can think of is what treasure is has? That is despicable!~
@1410 = ~Despicable, practical, whatever. All I know is this overgrown lizard will have hoarded a pile of gold bigger than your head, if that is at all possible, and it's just ripe for the pilfering!~
@1411 = ~(mutter) Here we go again. Just shut up, Annoyman... ~
@1412 = ~What did you say?~
@1413 = ~Say? What are you on about?~
@1414 = ~You said something!~
@1415 = ~Did I?~
@1416 = ~I don't think so--maybe you need to get your ears checked? (mutter) Or possibly a pin for that swollen head of yours... ~
@1417 = ~What you say or do not say is beneath my notice, fiendling. <CHARNAME>, as I was saying, an adventuring company that contains such... dregs... as this is hardly worthy of the name.~
@1418 = ~"There once was an elf with demon blood,
whom in the past treated all as mud,
but then she was captured, 
and escaped broken and fractured,
And after her still they trudge!"~
@1419 = ~W-what? Where did you pick up that load of nonsense?! Answer me!~
@1420 = ~Watch yourself here, <CHARNAME>. I have a bad feeling about this. This guy is obviously nuts... you just *know* he's not going to ask you to do his shopping for him.~
@1421 = ~Hey, you! Lass with the tail!~
@1422 = ~It wasn't me! I didn't do it, no one saw me do it, you can't prove anything!!~
@1423 = ~Err... whatever. See this mighty fine sphere, here? You can have it for your very own for a mere 500 gold pieces!  What do you say?~
@1424 = ~What? You're having a laugh! Everyone and his dog knows the Wizards want in on that place. I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot barge pole!~
@1425 = ~(grin) This guy is *great*! He's just pure entertainment itself! Can we keep him?~
@1426 = ~Do not mock those here! Can't you see that their minds are broken? For shame!~
@1427 = ~Such a strange palm. I see great conflict here... you fight against your true nature, and it is a battle you worry about losing.~
@1428 = ~You do not need concern yourself, though. There is one... one who will help you face your personal demons. You will not be lost again. Take heart from this and learn to let go.~
@1429 = ~But there is strength in you, even if you do not believe it yet. Listen to yourself--do not doubt! What may not seem right to begin with will soon reveal itself to be true.~
@1430 = ~I... hope you're right. Thank you, anyway. (She throws a quick glance your way)~
@1431 = ~Hmmm... we'll see. Thank you, anyway.~
@1432 = ~Fade! You're a hard person to find. The Shadow Master wishes your prompt return to the Stronghold--he has a new job for you. Do not delay!~
@1433 = ~A new job? I see. <CHARNAME>, I'm sorry, I will have to go. When the Shadow Master summons you, you have to go.~
@1434 = ~Of course, Fade. We will go immediately.~
@1435 = ~We have more important things to do here. Surely Aran can wait?~
@1436 = ~Yet again, Aran snaps his fingers and you go running. I would have hoped that your feelings for me would have meant that your loyalties also lay with me. I guess I am wrong.~
@1437 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I knew I could count on you.~
@1438 = ~Aran doesn't tolerate waiting. We should go and see what he wants as quickly as we can. Please, it must be important if he is dispatching messengers to find me!~
@1439 = ~Okay, we'll go and see what he wants.~
@1440 = ~No! I will not be ordered around by him anymore! If you want to go, Fade, fine--but I'm not going with you!~
@1441 = ~Of course my loyalties lie with you! Please don't be like that, <CHARNAME>!  It must be important if he is dispatching messengers to find me, however. Please... let us go and at least see what he wants.~
@1442 = ~You leave me no choice then! I have to go.~
@1443 = ~Ah, you're here--and I thank you for your prompt return. I need you to do something for me.~
@1444 = ~Yes, sir. What do you wish of me?~
@1445 = ~It is a matter that needs some delicate handling. However, you, <CHARNAME>, do not have to involve yourself in this, if you don't want to. This is a job for Fade.~
@1446 = ~If it is a job for Fade, then it is also a job for me. Tell us what you want us to do.~
@1447 = ~But if Fade undertakes this mission, she will no longer be a part of my life, and I cannot allow that. What does this mission involve?~
@1448 = ~Really? I don't have to get involved? Now *that's* a novel idea.~
@1449 = ~Well, if that's the case, I have better things to do. See ya, Fade!~
@1450 = ~Well, I see you are here at last! When your Shadow Master calls, Fade, you know better than to leave him waiting! What happened?~
@1451 = ~Yes, sir. I know, sir, and I apologise. We got caught up in other things... I'm very, very sorry. Now we are here, what do you wish us to do?~
@1452 = ~Even so, I expect better from my thieves! This is a matter that needs some delicate handling--I need to know I can rely on you. However, you, <CHARNAME>, do not have to involve yourself in this, if you don't want to. This is a job for Fade.~
@1453 = ~So, you've come, then?  I must admit I was surprised when Fade returned alone--and I am not very pleased that she has insisted to wait and see if you followed her! When I have a job to be done, I expect it to be done immediately!~
@1454 = ~Yes, sir. I know, sir, and I'm sorry, sir. I just don't know if I can undertake the mission without <CHARNAME>'s help, and I just wanted a little time to see if he would follow me...~
@1455 = ~W-Would you like to explain what is going on, or should I?~
@1456 = ~I shall explain. It is a matter that needs some delicate handling. However, unlike my errant sneak, I do not believe you have to involve yourself in this, <CHARNAME>, if you don't want to. This is a job for Fade.~
@1457 = ~In that case... there have been some nasty attacks recently, undertaken by a person, or people, unknown. Go to the Five Flagons Inn--there are two contacts there who will give you more details.~
@1458 = ~I see. Well, in that case... there have been some nasty attacks recently, undertaken by a person, or people, unknown. Go to the Five Flagons Inn--there are two contacts there who will give you more details.~
@1459 = ~<CHARNAME>... does that mean you wish for me to undertake this myself, and leave the party?~
@1460 = ~No, of course not! I just meant it's a novel idea that I'm not being used to sort out everyone else's problems! Of course I will help you.~
@1461 = ~Yep. I have better things to do. Sorry, but you know how it is.~
@1462 = ~Then I will undertake this mission myself. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. I thought we had something special; obviously I was wrong. You will not see me again.~
@1463 = ~Talk to Darla.~
@1464 = ~You're not the one we've come to meet, are you? No, I don't think so!~
@1465 = ~You're back! Did you find the person? Was it who you thought it was? Are they sorted out now? What, no? Then what are you waiting for?~
@1466 = ~Well, I think we've been of as much use as we can! Good luck--we're off now!~
@1467 = ~Fade! Aran said you were going to look into this for him. And is this your new friend?~
@1468 = ~Hello! I'm Darla--I'm a halfling, and this is Ella--she's a halfling too. Only she doesn't talk much, which some people think is a bit odd for halflings, but in our village that was okay because we didn't have much to do with the big folk, except when we went hunting them, but we don't do that anymore... well, not here anyway because people don't really appreciate that, but there again you city folk have the same opinions on orcs, and I've met some *perfectly* nice orcs in my time, just as...~
@1469 = ~Darla...~
@1470 = ~Hmm? As I was saying, we had more to do with orcs in the village. There were some gnomes too, nice people, we set up a Halfling Benevolent Society with them... well, it was more of a "Smaller Persons Benevolent Society", but there were more halflings in it than gnomes, but people thought it was a front for a Thieves' Guild! It was an honest establishment, most of the stock obtained through noble means... I mean, half the time the stuff wasn't even being used, and it's such a shame that people will let good things go to waste like that...~
@1471 = ~DARLA!! Please just shut up and listen--it's important!~
@1472 = ~That's the problem with the big folk--always so self-important!~
@1473 = ~Darla, please, Aran said you had some information for me about these strange people. He wouldn't be more specific than that about it, only that he said it was best if I dealt with it. What is going on?~
@1474 = ~Well... and I'm only saying this because you're asking and all... but yes, there have been some strange goings on. People're getting killed again... and... and...~
@1475 = ~And... what? Why do I have to deal with it? Tell me, Darla!~
@1476 = ~(sigh) And... "they" say that one of the people doing it has long, crimson hair and a tail. Remind you of anyone?~
@1477 = ~What?! They are saying it is me?? Who are "they" anyway?~
@1478 = ~You know... "them". The unidentified masses. And "they" aren't saying it's you as such. Only people who know you would recognise the description. We also know it isn't you--these things have been happening whilst you've been traipsing around with loverboy here. We have no idea what these people want. It just seems a bit... odd, don't you think?~
@1479 = ~That depends. There could be a reason for it. I just hope I'm wrong.~
@1480 = ~Well, the last time this person was sighted was in the Docks District--somewhere near the Thieves' Guild. I guess that's as good a place to start as any. Good luck!~
@1481 = ~Yeah. Thanks, Darla. You too, Ella.~
@1482 = ~No problem. Take care, okay?~
@1483 = ~Ella?! That was nearly a whole conversation!~
@1484 = ~Hey there, girlie! You're back! Did you find the person? Was it who you thought it was? Are they sorted out now? Did you--~
@1485 = ~Darla, zip it. Here, take a look at this letter. What do you make of it?~
@1486 = ~Fade, this is really serious! I mean... these guys mean business, don't they?~
@1487 = ~I'm afraid they do. You're good at solving problems. Where would you begin looking?~
@1488 = ~"The bowels of the city..." Well, that could be anywhere, couldn't it? Lots of places to hide...~
@1489 = ~Sewers.~
@1490 = ~I think Ella is right. The sewers would be as good as any place to start looking. Take care, y'hear?~
@1491 = ~Do I know you? No, I believe not. I suggest you leave here before I lose my limited patience and decide to gut you like the Lesser you are.~
@1492 = ~Well, well. If it isn't my dear long-lost sister.~
@1493 = ~Xek'ral... I had hoped it wasn't you, but I suppose it was inevitable.~
@1494 = ~So, sister dear... I had been led to believe you were already dead, but no, here you are, turning up like a bad copper. Have you been enjoying yourself over the years away from us?~
@1495 = ~Though I must say, I don't think much of the company you're keeping. Tut, tut. Gallivanting with Lessers, no less.~
@1496 = ~For someone who thought I was dead, you don't seem too surprised to see me! And how DARE you pass judgment on <CHARNAME> and his companions like that!~
@1497 = ~Ahh, I see that some of your infernal wrath has not left you--there may be hope for you still! Yes, Cirion told us you were dead, but you know better than to trust that old snake.~
@1498 = ~And besides, someone yelled @231 after me once, and I seem to remember that being the stupid soubriquet you started to go by before you left. I knew then that you weren't dead. Pity.~
@1499 = ~Cirion? Cirion is here?? Where is he?! Why have you come here to Athkatla? Must I forever be haunted by you all?!~
@1500 = ~Oh, please, get over yourself. You always were the selfish one. We're not here for you! We have better and more important things to do. In fact, killing you would just be a nice bonus for me. Goodbye, sister dear.~
@1501 = ~Hello, Roger. Have you by any chance seen any strange people come through here recently?~
@1502 = ~Ahh! Yes! A troupe of some most... unusual characters did make their way through here some time ago. I was going to see if they wanted some of my fine merchandise, but as soon as I saw the head fellow, I changed my mind... a most evil-looking chap!~
@1503 = ~Where did they head?~
@1504 = ~Why, they took the north-west entrance, deeper into the sewer system.~
@1505 = ~Thank you, Roger. You have been most helpful.~
@1506 = ~Has anyone else come past here recently?~
@1507 = ~Yes, a most unsavoury group! Michel went to speak to them, to warn them of the dangers ahead, but they... killed him. They have not returned this way--I can only assume they have either perished, or are still down there. I would advise that you avoid them!~
@1508 = ~But... but what business have you here, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@1509 = ~I don't think that's going to be an option, but thank you anyway.~
@1510 = ~Again we are disturbed. I warn you, leave this place now--or suffer the slowest and more agonizing death I can devise.~
@1511 = ~Again we are disturbed. No matter, it has been some time since we had any real sport, so...~
@1512 = ~Hello, Cirion. Long time no see.~
@1513 = ~What? Kher'tal? My my my, it *has* been a long time! Your dear brother Xek'ral thought you might be around here--and to think I told him he was being silly! But there you stand, larger than life... how are you?~
@1514 = ~How am I? HOW AM I?!? You sold me into SLAVERY, you bastard!!~
@1515 = ~Oh yes, so I did. Well, I had to make some coin, didn't I? Being told what to do for a change was not to your taste, I take it? Although I would imagine everything else was... you always were a rather rampant one. "Fuck it then kill it" was your motto, I seem to remember.~
@1516 = ~Anyway, your appearance here is immaterial. We are not here for you--we have another, more important goal. So take your... oh my, you're traveling with Lessers now... your "people" and leave us be.~
@1517 = ~I can't leave, you know this! I'm going to make you *pay*, Cirion!~
@1518 = ~You are going to make ME pay? Kher'tal, I commend your spirit, but--~
@1519 = ~DON'T CALL ME THAT!! I am NOT Kher'tal anymore! You made sure of that! You tore me from my life without a second thought, discarded me as so much rubbish! If you think I'm going to walk away from you now, you're sorely mistaken!~
@1520 = ~I warn you, Kher'tal, I am in no mood for your stupidity and temper tantrums. We are here for the Rift Device, and you are not going to stop us.~
@1521 = ~Ha! You're here after the Device? Well, you're too late! It's gone, destroyed! By <CHARNAME> here, no less!~
@1522 = ~WHAT?!? That cannot be true...~
@1523 = ~It is! So now what are you going to do?!~
@1524 = ~You leave me no choice...~
@1525 = ~The Device? Are you mad? It'll destroy you!~
@1526 = ~I doubt that--remember your heritage! It may destroy the Lessers, but we will be able to wield it!~
@1527 = ~In that case, I have another reason to kill you!~
@1528 = ~Back so soon, Fade?~
@1529 = ~You bastard! You knew!! You knew they were my family!! Why didn't you tell me?!~
@1530 = ~Fade, back away now! Yes, I did know--that is why you had to deal with it! I couldn't send anyone else--they wouldn't have stood a chance. I had to send someone who knew their ways!~
@1531 = ~So you manipulated me, yet again! Why were you even involved?~
@1532 = ~Politics. Underground crimes have to be dealt with sometimes by underground people, the Council knows this, and it is essential to our survival as a Guild. I don't expect you to understand.~
@1533 = ~You're right, I don't understand! But understand this, Aran--I will *never* be manipulated like this again!~
@1534 = ~And just what do you mean by that?~
@1535 = ~I... I'm leaving the Shadow Thieves, Aran. Now. For good.~
@1536 = ~(laugh) Do you think it is that easy? You can't just "leave", Fade. This isn't some two-bit operation you can back out of whenever you please!~
@1537 = ~She said she wants to leave, Aran, and you can't stop her. She's put up with a lot in her life, and now she's had enough. Let her go.~
@1538 = ~He's right, Fade. You joined the Shadow Thieves knowing this. You can't just leave like that.~
@1539 = ~<CHARNAME>, you're not going to back me up on this? I... I can't do this without your support!~
@1540 = ~I am not unreasonable, Fade. I will allow you to continue your travels, but you still remain under my direction. That is all I have to say on the matter. Good day.~
@1541 = ~Then I am still someone else's lackey. <CHARNAME>... I had hoped you would stand up for me, that your feelings would have prevailed here. Obviously not. Nothing will ever be the same between us anymore. Ever.~
@1542 = ~You dare threaten me? You would not live out the day.~
@1543 = ~<CHARNAME>, no! This is not the way to go about this! Just... please, Aran... let me go. I can't stay here. I need to be with <CHARNAME>.~
@1544 = ~You "need" to be with him? Hmmm. I had heard the rumour that the two of you had formed an attachment. I see now that it is deeper than the rumours gave credit. Fade, you must understand--in letting you leave, I risk my guild!~
@1545 = ~I would never betray you, Aran! You have been good to me, but I need to go my own way, do my own thing! For too long have I been at the beck and call of others!~
@1546 = ~And now you will be at the beck and call of <CHARNAME>! Can't you see that?~
@1547 = ~Yes, I can. But the difference is, I love him. Simple as that.~
@1548 = ~(sigh) Then you would leave anyway, and I would be forced to hunt you down. At least this way, you can go with my blessing. <CHARNAME>... look after her.~
@1549 = ~Y-you mean...~
@1550 = ~Yes, you can leave. But if I hear that you have betrayed us in any way, I *will* hunt you down. Do I make myself clear?~
@1551 = ~Absolutely! Th-thank you, Aran.~
@1552 = ~You love her? Hmmm. I had heard the rumour that the two of you had formed an attachment. I see now that it is deeper than the rumours gave credit. Fade, you must understand--in letting you leave, I risk my guild!~
@1553 = ~And who are you to tell me this? You want her to leave so she can follow you around the countryside! I can't just "let her go"!~
@1554 = ~You can, and you will! Even if I have to kill you first!~
@1555 = ~I want her to leave because I love her, Aran! She's never been more than a useful tool to you, but she's everything to me. I want to see her happy for a change. Let her leave!~
@1556 = ~You turn to Fade, your unusual Fey'ri companion who has recently become so dear to you. You can see by the apprehensive look she is giving the stair that she is worried, frightened even, but before you can speak, she holds your hand to her lips and kisses it gently.~
@1557 = ~You turn to Fade, your unusual Fey'ri companion who has changed so much since you first met her. You can see by the apprehensive look she is giving the stair that she is worried... frightened even.~
@1558 = ~Fade, this is not your fight. You don't have to do this is you don't want to.~
@1559 = ~Well, this is it. I have to be sure I can count on you when the time comes. Are you sure you want to go through with this?~
@1560 = ~This is your last chance to back out of this. I won't blame you if you want to return to the Shadow Thieves.~
@1561 = ~I'd be lying if I said I wasn't terrified... but I would not leave you to face this alone. Not only because of all the things you have done for me, but because of what you are to me--my heart and soul.~
@1562 = ~Know this: I would have traveled to the edges of Faerun and beyond just to be with you, just to help you. Let us face Irenicus. Let us make you whole again!~
@1563 = ~This is as much my fight as yours, <CHARNAME>... abandoning you now is just not an option. Let us face Irenicus. Let us make you whole again!~
@1564 = ~(She hesitates for a second) Yes, I am sure. We have come this far... I could not abandon you now. Let us face Irenicus. Let us make you whole again!~
@1565 = ~But I would blame myself forever if I abandoned you now. Leaving is just not an option, <CHARNAME>! Let us face Irenicus. Let us make you whole again!~
@1566 = ~Wha-what happened? I... felt you calling, I knew I had to follow, that I could not leave, but... oh no. Can't you feel it? We're in the Hells! My blood will rebel here, <CHARNAME>... this feels so fundamentally wrong to me! Let us find a way out of here, and fast.~
@1567 = ~Wha-what happened? <CHARNAME>, my love... are you alright? Where are you?! I... felt you calling, I knew I had to follow, that I could not leave, but... oh no. Can't you feel it? We're in the Hells! My blood will rebel here, <CHARNAME>... this feels so fundamentally wrong to me! Let us find a way out of here, and fast.~
@1568 = ~So you thought you could cheat your fate, Irenicus? You should know better than that! My whole race are considered traitors by the rest of the elven community, but what you did would sicken even them! And now you are here in Hell. There can be only one outcome. You will stay here and ROT!!~
@1569 = ~We have not disguised our motives! The Shadow Master simply sought to rid Athkatla of you and your corrupted kin. Why should he not have employed <CHARNAME> to help, considering <PRO_HISHER> goals are so similar to ours?~
@1570 = ~Then you are indeed a naive and, dare I say it, ridiculously stupid individual. Of course there is intent, one that your precious Shadow Master has chosen not to divulge to you. A wise course, considering you obviously cannot watch your mouth.~
@1571 = ~Never have we hidden our intentions! The Shadow Master simply sought to rid Athkatla of you and your corrupted kin. Why should he not have employed <CHARNAME> to help, considering <PRO_HISHER> goals are so similar to ours?~
@1572 = ~For your information, <CHARNAME>'s "employers" intend nothing that hasn't already been laid out! The Shadow Master simply sought to rid Athkatla of you and your corrupted kin. Why should he not have employed <CHARNAME> to help, considering <PRO_HISHER> goals are so similar to ours?~
@1573 = ~Too damn right you have a guest! One that would rather like to spit you on the end of her sword, given the choice. Leave that poor wench alone!~
@1574 = ~And who are you to order *me* around? Who are you, <MANWOMAN>? Where are my useless guards?~
@1575 = ~Vampirism I can help with, but this... this is something else entirely. Speak with my fellow brother; he may be able help you.~
@1576 = ~I doubt it... I've never been one to do *anything* quietly.~
@1577 = ~Come now... I'm sure we can come to some kind of... arrangement?~
@1578 = ~Arrangement? What kind of... arrangement do you have in mind, wench?~
@1579 = ~Simple, really. If you let us in, I can be sure to make it worth your while...~
@1580 = ~Fade, no! I know you have used such... tactics in the past to get your own way, but you don't have to do it now. There are other ways!~
@1581 = ~Good girl--this will make it easier by far! Just don't take too long, okay?~
@1582 = ~I... I was only trying to help, <CHARNAME>. I thought it would be the easiest and quickest way to get an audience. Don't you think it would work?~
@1583 = ~Considering what is on offer, I'm absolutely sure it would work, but I'm not willing to let the likes of him paw at you, even if it makes achieving my goals easier.~
@1584 = ~Whether or not it would work is not the issue here. I will not allow you to prostitute yourself this way, ever.~
@1585 = ~Probably not. I am sure the likes of the Pirate Lord and his lackeys have pretty women throwing themselves at them all the time. Another one isn't going to make a difference.~
@1586 = ~I *was* just going to take him to one side and knock him over the head, <CHARNAME>--I do have some measure of pride!~
@1587 = ~That is... very sweet of you, <CHARNAME>. Like I said, I was just trying to help. I... hope you do not think any less of me.~
@1588 = ~That is very noble of you, <CHARNAME>. I was actually thinking of getting him on his own and knocking him over the head. But... thanks anyway. (smile)~
@1589 = ~Gee, thanks, <CHARNAME>. You sure do know how to make a girl feel good about herself. Again I don't know if I should be insulted or honoured!~
@1590 = ~I thought I said for you to go away! Hanging around here trying to bargain entry with comely wenches just doesn't work, you know. Like I said, you need an appointment!~
@1591 = ~Elhan! I've the half vampire body of Fade here because of you! You'll tell me now!~
@1592 = ~I understand what you ask, child, although I would have thought you may already have guessed, since one of your party has a hint of the planes about her already. (She smiles at Fade)~
@1593 = ~We are people from distant lands and all of us are of mixed heritage.  Please, my good <MANWOMAN>... will you aid us?~
@1594 = ~Uh-oh... that's not good. Who in all the Nine Hells would go to all this effort to implicate you in the slaughter of those knights? I think it's going to take a bit more than a hopeful smile and a slice of Apology Cake to smooth this one over.~
@1595 = ~Missy, we have this discussion every time I come in here. Do you see me wearing a coat? Have you *ever* known me to wear a coat? And more to the point, what the hell would I want with your coats anyway?! No one wants your damn coats! The only reason the apprentices nick things from them in the first place is to wind you up! Now chill out!~
@1596 = ~I tell you, it's a blinking miracle Aran has any recruits left after that sadist has finished with them...~
@1597 = ~Last time I looked, girl, *I* was the expert on traps and training 'round here. Out of my way.~
@1598 = ~Have you completed your mission? No, I don't think you have. Come and speak to me once you're done.~
@1599 = ~Yes, Aran, I'll do that.~
@1600 = ~There's something else I want to discuss.~
@1601 = ~Ah... the matter of your little sea voyage? I must admit, after you left on Havarian's ship, I half-wondered if you would reach the island, never mind return.~
@1602 = ~This is hardly the time for discussion, <CHARNAME>. Go now... go to the graveyard and enter the catacombs when you are ready. My best assassins will meet you there, and I hope they will be enough. Now... I must make preparations, so excuse me.~
@1603 = ~There is nothing left to discuss, <CHARNAME>. I have told you my decision. Kill Bodhi, but do it without my help... and we shall be even. Now leave this place at once.~
@1604 = ~What could that be? Bodhi is dead, is she not? Incidentally, <CHARNAME>, I am very pleased. The Shadow Thieves at large can breathe a sigh of relief, now. A job well done.~
@1605 = ~Ah, Anomen--I say good riddance to them! Now you can live your life the way you want to, rather than by any stuffy old code. Come on; a drink and laugh will soon make you forget all about this nonsense.~
@1606 = ~Nonsense? I have been denied my one dream, my one goal, and you call it nonsense?! How dare they refuse me! How *dare* they!~
@1607 = ~I hear congratulations are in order, Anomen. I for one never thought you'd make it, but well done anyway.~
@1608 = ~You... you are congratulating me? Then I accept your congratulations with good grace, Fade. Just as long as you realise what this means. I am now a knight, and so cannot turn a blind eye to your larcenous ways.~
@1609 = ~Y'hear that, y' naughty thievin' squeakie? Ye've got ye're own little watchman after ye! I'd watch that sweet arse o' yez if I were ye.~
@1610 = ~Heh... he'll have to catch me first!~
@1611 = ~Larcenous? What does that mean? Boo thinks you may be insulting our friend Fade.~
@1612 = ~'Tis not an insult, Minsc--nothing of the sort! You yourself talk about fighting evil, and your "friend" Fade here is a proponent of that evil.~
@1613 = ~Now you lose even Boo! Proponent?~
@1614 = ~Don't worry, Minsc, Anomen is just kidding around. (grin) Without me, he wouldn't have that nice, shiny new armour he's wearing... would he?~
@1615 = ~So, I've got to watch myself, do I? Well, I'll bear that in mind the next time I'm earning my keep. (wink) Thanks for the tip-off, pal!~
@1616 = ~Come on, lad... just remember why you're doing it. Remember what he did to us and our Guild. He deserves punishment.~
@1617 = ~He *deserves* punishment? And from one who flouts the law so openly? What would you know of such things? Again, I find your morality somewhat twisted, Fade.~
@1618 = ~Sometimes this is the only language people understand. As Booter said, he was scum. Leave it at that.~
@1619 = ~(grin) Oh, sure... you were just"'wandering", weren't you Cuchul? And it just happened to be a bordello... my, my! Wasn't *that* just a stroke of pure luck...~
@1620 = ~(grin) Shut it, you! T'was a mistake anyone could o' made. Like I was sayin'... Caught one o' the girls changin'... she didn't mind, none.  Yup... t'was a good night. Came out even, too, helpin' the girls throw out the drunks.  Some of 'em was rich drunks.~
@1621 = ~(wink) A good ruse if you can pull it off, I must admit!~
@1622 = ~(grin) Well, apart from the odd halfling or gnome, I canna be pullin' off *yer* tricks, can I? "Oh, sir, I've been abandoned in this here rough tavern... I wonder how I'm gonna get home safe"... bat eyelashes, waggle arse a bit.~
@1623 = ~Ye've got less morals n'a cat, Fade! Funny hows they all fall fer it, though, what with you havin' that bloody weird tail... 'tis beyond me!~
@1624 = ~(smirk) Just all part of the charm, Mit. You show me a man who doesn't wonder what I can actually *do* with this thing, and I'll show you a liar.~
@1625 = ~But very, very effective... (wink)~
@1626 = ~And a brilliant ruse for the rest of us, eh Mit? (grin)~
@1627 = ~Ware treachery! Treachery against the Shadow Master! The Guild is betrayed!~
@1628 = ~Oh, shite... I didn't see *you* there!~
@1629 = ~Oh, I don't know... I would imagine Cuchul's underwear would come at least a close second.~
@1630 = ~Har har! I think ye'd be roight there, lass--now there's a lad that needs t'be learnin' that water doan' kill ye!~
@1631 = ~Oh, come on, <CHARNAME>! It's not foolishness--she's just tired. Maybe we could all do with a rest.~
@1632 = ~Th-thank you, Fade. As I said, I just have a... bad feeling...~
@1633 = ~Not just a filthy slaver, but you're proud of it, too. I'll do more to your face than spit in it--I'll rearrange it with my blade! Jaheira should have killed you when she had the chance--her punishment was *nothing* compared to what I would have done to you!~
@1634 = ~And I would also be careful of expressing such sentiments so publicly... you never know who's listening, and you wouldn't want to become a target now, would you?~
@1635 = ~Oh, yes... I'm sure every man wants one of the souvenirs you're offering--running sores and ruptured pustules should be on *every* man's wish list. Leave him alone!~
@1636 = ~Now what're ye laughin' at? I'm tellin' ye, three it was!~
@1637 = ~You must've done a good job then, since no one has been reported missing or anything!~
@1638 = ~I can 'ave ye banned if I wants to, y'know.~
@1639 = ~Don't be foolish, <CHARNAME>. I saw her trying exactly the same line on some poor fool in the Flagons the other day. Got herself ploughed and now wants payment... I say good luck to her if it works on other poor sods, but you *know* this child isn't yours!~
@1640 = ~Not true! I need 100 gold pieces will allow your little girl to live a half-decent life. For a while.~
@1641 = ~(grin) Oooh, Korgan, you protest too much! We all know you want to help, but can't bring yourself to admit it due to your rough dwarven exterior...~
@1642 = ~That's enough, fiendling! Ye be treadin' on unsafe ground there--any more comments like that'n ye'll be feelin' the flat o' me axe against yer backside, so ye shall!~
@1643 = ~Umar Hills? Never been there. Nice excuse for a little... excursion, eh? And help the poor lad and all that too, of course!~
@1644 = ~What in the Abyss is a Red Wizard doing working for the Shadow Thieves? I don't like this...~
@1645 = ~<CHARNAME>! At least find out his side of the story first!~
@1646 = ~Wh-hat? Wait,don't I recognise you? You're Aran's tailed lass! Are you mad? If Mae'Var finds out...~
@1647 = ~Don't worry about me, Embarl. I know where my loyalties lie, and I'll stand by them when the time comes. <CHARNAME>, there is no need to kill this poor sod. We're here to put a stop to this kind of thing!~
@1648 = ~Sorry, Fade. Business is business.~
@1649 = ~All right then. We'll give you a chance. What misunderstanding were you talking about?~
@1650 = ~Killing the Bloodscalp? This is serious! How many Guild members are we talking about?~
@1651 = ~A fair few. Mae'Var rules through fear, but does allow "privileges" the other Guild leaders wouldn't tolerate. He's got them convinced they'd be better off with the Bloodscalp around!~
@1652 = ~And since Renal is a staunch supporter of the Shadowmaster, getting rid of him would have the added bonus of making the Shadowmaster's position potentially weaker and easier to topple...~
@1653 = ~I... I didn't think of it that way!~
@1654 = ~Shows what you know! There is, contrary to popular belief, honour amongst thieves! He wouldn't betray <CHARNAME>--<PRO_HESHE> spared his life!  Mae'Var is the traitor here, not that poor sod!~
@1655 = ~I'm glad you didn't kill him, <CHARNAME>. His only crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Don't worry, he won't betray you--he owes you his life.~
@1656 = ~You're kidding... right? I mean, everyone has to make a living, but I had thought you above such things!~
@1657 = ~I would think *very* hard about what you're saying, <CHARNAME>, I really would...~
@1658 = ~Hey, hang on! What are you implying? He doesn't need some simpering child fawning all over him, he's got me! I'd be VERY careful in what you're going to say next, if I were you...~
@1659 = ~Y-you are this noble Paladin's betrothed? I... I find that very hard to believe.~
@1660 = ~Why, you little witch! We may not be officially betrothed, but this is *my* man, and if anyone *dares* suggest otherwise...~
@1661 = ~Fade, calm down.~
@1662 = ~Okay, I think that's enough! My Lady, I am very flattered by your implication, but as Fade says, we are as one. If I fight, I fight in her name, and for her love.~
@1663 = ~Uh, honeykitten? While it's very sweet of you to be that protective of our relationship, I fear you are scaring Iltha.~
@1664 = ~(grin) What's wrong, Fade? Don't like the competition? I can't help it if a pretty girl wants a paladin to fight in her name.~
@1665 = ~I am calm! I just wanted to make it completely clear that no mere chit of a girl is going to start making grand claims on your affections, that's all!~
@1666 = ~So take your grand designs for my knight, missy, and bugger off!~
@1667 = ~Okay, I think that's enough! My Lady, I am very flattered by your implication, but as Fade says in her slightly coarse way, we are as one. If I fight, I fight in her name, and for her love.~
@1668 = ~Uh, honeykitten? While it's very sweet of you to be that protective of our relationship, I fear you are being just a mite scary.~
@1669 = ~I see. 'Tis unfortunate; I will consider ours a tragic affection that will never be realized. Just as the tales of courtly love are all about unrequited romance.~
@1670 = ~Uh, I do not fear your... female, but I would never dream of crossing her. I will consider ours a tragic affection that will never be realized. Just as the tales of courtly love are all about unrequited romance.~
@1671 = ~<CHARNAME>, it does not do for a paladin to toy with the feelings of others so lightly. Although I myself wonder what on earth the two of you have in common, you have committed yourself to Fade, and it is only fair that Iltha knows this.~
@1672 = ~(grin) Hey, thanks Dad! You tell him!~
@1673 = ~D-Dad? (sigh) I supposed I asked for that...~
@1674 = ~If that is truly the case, then I will consider ours a tragic affection that will never be realized. Just as the tales of courtly love are all about unrequited romance.~
@1675 = ~Carry on playing that game, and you'll soon regret it, <CHARNAME>. Just remember, I can withdraw certain "privileges" at any time, if you get my meaning...~
@1676 = ~Har har! She's got ye there, so she has! I'm bettin' the fiendling's more willin' t'bend over for ye than *that* chit! Good on ye, girlie!~
@1677 = ~Korgan... that was *not* an invitation for you to get involved!~
@1678 = ~I... see. If that is truly the, uh, case, I will consider ours a tragic affection that will never be realized. Just as the tales of courtly love are all about unrequited romance.~
@1679 = ~Don't play games, <CHARNAME>! It's not fair on me or whatsherface there. I... I don't want you to fight in my name, but don't play with my feelings like this--it's not, well, nice.~
@1680 = ~You truly are together? Then in that case, I will consider ours a tragic affection that will never be realized. Just as the tales of courtly love are all about unrequited romance.~
@1681 = ~And why would he need you to do that for him? There are others more than willing to fulfil that role! I mean... you know... people he actually knows... possibly...~
@1682 = ~Fade, what are you saying?~
@1683 = ~N-nothing! Accept the wench's pledge. It matters little to me.~
@1684 = ~Then I will take great comfort in your faith, Iltha.~
@1685 = ~A well-intentioned gesture, but my... friend has the right of it. I should fight in the name of one I have genuine feelings for. I hope you understand.~
@1686 = ~That I do. You will prevail. Of this I am sure.~
@1687 = ~Now then, something simple and direct to begin with. You emerged from the home of the Drow, and you have one of just an evil heritage as they in your party. Were you fleeing or are you in league with them?~
@1688 = ~Evil heritage? You mean Fade, don't you? I see... because I have a Fey'ri in my party, it means I *must* be in league with the Drow.~
@1689 = ~I warn you--such games are dangerous. If it were not for my sages, I would strike you down now. She may not be Drow, but her kind are viewed in the same light.~
@1690 = ~Unfortunately, I must bring up a final point of contention. I refer of course to the Fey'ri. I cannot allow her to accompany you on this most delicate of missions.~
@1691 = ~In that case, I leave your fate to <CHARNAME>. I still have reservations... but as they say, desperate times lead to desperate measures. I will, however, be watching you carefully. Do not give me cause to doubt you.~
@1692 = ~Especially since there is still the matter of the Fey'ri you bring with you. I will return to her later, rest assured.~
@1693 = ~They will pay close attention to your next statement, especially since you are already damned for having a Drow traveling with you... not to mention one of just an evil heritage as she.~
@1694 = ~Evil heritage? Oh, sure. Just because I have Fade and Viconia in my party, that means I *must* be in league with the Drow.~
@1695 = ~Unfortunately, I must bring up a final point of contention. I refer of course to the Fey'ri and the Drow. I cannot allow them to accompany you.~
@1696 = ~Something more, however, must be done about the Drow. Her kind are treacherous and black-hearted, and none are in a better position to know this than we.~
@1697 = ~Especially since there is still the matter of the Drow and the Fey'ri you bring with you. I will return to them later, rest assured.~
@1698 = ~True.~
@1699 = ~I concur. True. She does indeed wish to help us.~
@1700 = ~I assure you, Elhan, I bear no ill-will to you or the elves of your fair city. Long have our kind been estranged, and so maybe you are not aware that not all of us heed the call of our heritage. I am not a threat--I sincerely wish to help. Have your sages test me--I do not fear their answer.~
@1701 = ~I have actually come back to enquire about that... item we discussed last time. Do you still have it?~
@1702 = ~Actually... for 100 gold, I'll show you something rather special... something I think you may appreciate.~
@1703 = ~Okay, here's 100 gold. Show me this rather special something.~
@1704 = ~No, thanks. Just show me your special stock of items.~
@1705 = ~What kind of item are we talking about?~
@1706 = ~(grin) I couldn't help noticing that you seem to be rather, shall we say, "involved" with that Shadow Thief, Fade. Well, she's a comely lass...~
@1707 = ~(He pulls out a handful of what looks like scrap chain mail from under the counter and grins.)~
@1708 = ~Is that what I think it is? I thought they were a joke!~
@1709 = ~Whoa! I don't know what you think I'm into, but getting my girl to dress up in inappropriate costumes is not one of them! Besides, she'd probably kill me.~
@1710 = ~Blimey... a chain mail bikini. (gulp) There's not a lot to it, is there?~
@1711 = ~Now we're cooking with charcoal! Once upon a time, I thought all these female warrior types strutted around the countryside in these. Alas, it was not to be. Hey, it's even got adjustable straps and everything!~
@1712 = ~Ahh, it's not something I would offer to just anyone. Like I said, you're a good customer, and I'm an observant person who prides himself in being able to supply my client's every need... and I think you may have a need for this. (wink)~
@1713 = ~Okay, go on, then. Here's my 100 gold.~
@1714 = ~Joke? No, not really. There are a few around, but you won't see them readily available for purchase just anywhere.~
@1715 = ~So, do you want to buy it? It'll cost you 1500 gold.~
@1716 = ~1500 gold! For that?! Are you out of your mind? Why should I pay such a huge fee for something so tiny?~
@1717 = ~You've got yourself a deal, Ribald. Nice doing business with you.~
@1718 = ~No, I don't think so. As nice as it may be for me, I don't think Fade would appreciate me buying her such things. I think a bunch of flowers would be more gratefully received!~
@1719 = ~Okay, yes, but keep your voice down. It's not the kind of, you know, "thing" I want to be seen buying.~
@1720 = ~That's a shame. I didn't have you marked as hen-pecked, but I suppose I was wrong. She's got you beaten good, huh?~
@1721 = ~There's nothing wrong with respecting the woman in your life, Ribald. As nice as it may be for me, I don't think Fade would appreciate me buying her such things. I think a bunch of flowers would be more gratefully received!~
@1722 = ~No, not at all! And to prove it, how much do you want for that bikini?~
@1723 = ~That is kind of the point. It would kind of lose its appeal if was ankle length, don't you think?~
@1724 = ~With that response, I take it you're interested? To you, it's only 1500 gold.~
@1725 = ~You'll pay it because that's how much it costs. Now, do we have a deal or not?~
@1726 = ~No, Ribald, we don't have a deal. That's daylight robbery!~
@1727 = ~Okay, you have yourself a deal, Ribald. Nice doing business with you.~
@1728 = ~Have fun.~
@1729 = ~Well, if you change your mind, just come and see me.~
@1730 = ~No need to be embarrassed, old Ribald is as discreet as a Madame in a paladin's restroom. Have fun now...~
@1731 = ~To you? 1500 gold. A bargain, I'm sure you'll agree.~
@1732 = ~You're entitled to your opinion, I suppose. But if you do change your mind, just come and see me.~
@1733 = ~(grin) Of course I do! So, you are interested in purchasing it after all?~
@1734 = ~No, I was just enquiring!~
@1735 = ~Hmmm. Enquiring. Okay, I'll hold on to it for a bit longer then, shall I?~
@1736 = ~I don't know why you put up with him speaking to you in that manner. It's not the first time. All he does is complain about his lot in life and then blow his top! As if he knows how hard life really can be.~
@1737 = ~Don't be hard on him, Fade--it's not really his fault. I think I'm the first person he's ever spoken to about all this... his bitterness is not aimed at me.~
@1738 = ~You're right. Sometimes I wonder why I put up with it. I suppose I feel a bit sorry for him.~
@1739 = ~I don't remember asking you for your opinion, Fade. And I don't take kindly to you eavesdropping on my conversations with Anomen either. If I need your advice, I'll ask for it. Is that clear?~
@1740 = ~Maybe not, but he still shouldn't take it out on you. I could have a word with him, if you'd like me to.~
@1741 = ~No, leave it. I think he feels bad enough about everything without adding your disapproval.~
@1742 = ~I really don't think that would solve anything. In fact, I think that may make matters worse. He doesn't really, well, respect your opinion much, does he?~
@1743 = ~Fade, please, let me handle this. I appreciate your concern, but I don't think there's anything you can do.~
@1744 = ~Feeling sorry for someone doesn't automatically give them permission to treat you like a verbal punch-bag, <CHARNAME>. Do you want me to have a word with him?~
@1745 = ~(She shakes her head disapprovingly and snorts.) Perfectly. Just don't come crying to me when he pushes you too far. I know his type--it's never their fault, always someone else's. Make sure you nip this in the bud before he takes it too far.~
@1746 = ~Well, to be honest, I don't really care how bad he would feel about my disapproval--I just don't want to hear him speaking to you like that again.~
@1747 = ~But I'll respect your wishes this time, <CHARNAME> and keep my own counsel. You know I'm here if you want me to "have a word" with our boy-playing-knight.~
@1748 = ~(snort) Does it look like I care if he respects my opinion? I'd *make* him respect it, if necessary. I just don't want to hear him speaking to you like that again.~
@1749 = ~(She shrugs her shoulders and smiles.) Okay, I'll let you handle this one. But please come to me if you want anything said to him; he really shouldn't use you as a way to vent his anger on the world. It's not right--even I know that!~
@1750 = ~(You find her sitting on her own, trying to remove her undershirt. It seems to have stuck somewhat to her back, and each time she pulls, it makes her whimper, obviously pulling against her abused back)~
@1751 = ~(leave her alone to deal with her wounds)~
@1752 = ~Here, let me help you with that.~
@1753 = ~(You pick up a damp rag and help her ease the cloth away from her skin. You grimace slightly as the scabs tear afresh and begin to bleed, but there is nothing you can do about it. A shuddering sob escapes Fade's lips as you eventually remove the shirt. Her back is criss-crossed with angry red stripes, fresh blood welling up within them)~
@1754 = ~Thank you. I can deal with the rest of it. You don't have to.~
@1755 = ~No, I'll help you. Do you want me to get some healing spells together? That should sort this out quickly enough.~
@1756 = ~Okay... as long as you're sure. If you need me, just yell. I'll be here as quickly as I can.~
@1757 = ~Fade, I didn't realize they'd beaten you quite so badly. They didn't do... anything else... to you, did they?~
@1758 = ~No, it would be a waste of spells. I'll be all right. They're only flesh wounds, after all. I just need to get clean and rest.~
@1759 = ~I know better than to argue with you, but at least take this potion, to help you heal. Do you need help cleaning your wounds?~
@1760 = ~Okay, as long as you're sure. Do you need any help cleaning your wounds?~
@1761 = ~Fair enough. I'll leave you to it, then. If you need me, just yell. I'll be here as quickly as I can.~
@1762 = ~I will, <CHARNAME>. And... thank you again.~
@1763 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. They didn't do anything else to me. Not this time. Why do you ask?~
@1764 = ~Because the beating you've taken makes me feel sick enough. I... couldn't stand the thought of you being abused in other ways, too. Not when I should have been there to prevent it.~
@1765 = ~No reason. I'm just... glad they didn't.~
@1766 = ~Okay. Thanks.~
@1767 = ~(She takes the potion from you and swigs it down, making a face as she does) Yeuch. You would think they'd make these things taste better, wouldn't you?~
@1768 = ~(She reaches for a clean cloth and dips it in the already bloody water)~
@1769 = ~That water needs to be changed if you want to clean your wounds, Fade. Let me do it for you.~
@1770 = ~(watch her begin to clean her wounds)~
@1771 = ~(She reaches for a clean cloth and dips it in the already bloody water) I... should be fine, <CHARNAME>.~
@1772 = ~No, I think I should help you. There's no way you'll be able to reach the wounds on your back, and they'll need to be bound.~
@1773 = ~<CHARNAME>... please, don't think like that. There's absolutely nothing else you could have done. This is hardly the worst beating I have taken, and flesh soon heals. It is enough for me that you came to... save me from them.~
@1774 = ~(She tries to smile, but her split and swollen lip makes it hard for her) I just need to clean these wounds and get some rest. I'll be all right.~
@1775 = ~Here, I'll help you. Do you want me to get some healing spells together? That should sort this out quickly enough.~
@1776 = ~Well, if you need me, just yell. I'll be here as quickly as I can.~
@1777 = ~(She tries to smile, but her split and swollen lip makes it hard for her) So am I. You don't have to stay. I just need to clean these wounds and get some rest. I'll be all right.~
@1778 = ~No, I do need to stay. Do you want me to get some healing spells together? That should sort this out quickly enough.~
@1779 = ~(She watches you as you leave to get fresh, hot water. When you return, she nods to you gratefully and tosses a couple of pungent-smelling leaves into the water--you recognize the aroma of some common cleansing herbs)~
@1780 = ~(Taking up the cloth, you steep it in the water. For a moment, Fade looks rebellious, and you wonder if she is going to allow you to clean her wounds for her; you know how brittle her pride can be. But then, to your relief, she nods slowly and lies on her belly)~
@1781 = ~(In order to have clear access to her back, you pin up her long red hair, still matted with blood. No matter how gentle you try to be, she still winces as you clean the lash-wounds)~
@1782 = ~I'm sorry. I'm trying to be as gentle as possible.~
@1783 = ~Fade, please try to keep still. I know it hurts, but the stiller you are, the quicker I can get this done.~
@1784 = ~(She begins by cleaning the wounds on her arms and then turns herself away from you so she can clean her back, obviously trying to maintain some vestige of modesty on her part. It is obvious to you, however, that she cannot reach or see the wounds on her back to clean them satisfactorily)~
@1785 = ~Fade, please. Let me change the water and help you.~
@1786 = ~I know you are. I... really appreciate you doing this, <CHARNAME>.~
@1787 = ~It's the least I can do, Fade. Sit up, now. Let me bandage that up for you, and see to your face and arms.~
@1788 = ~Do you want me to continue, or are you okay to finish this on your own?~
@1789 = ~I'm trying, <CHARNAME>, I really am. I... really appreciate you doing this, <CHARNAME>.~
@1790 = ~(She sits up slowly, still facing away from you, hugging herself, or so it seems)~
@1791 = ~Fade, I can't bandage you with you facing away from me, or without your arms up. Come on, please turn around.~
@1792 = ~Do you... not want me to do this? Would you rather finish it yourself?~
@1793 = ~I... don't think I could do this properly on my own. I think I need you to do it for me.~
@1794 = ~Okay then. I need you to turn around and hold your arms out for me.~
@1795 = ~(Still holding her arms to herself, she turns around to face you--the reason now obvious to you by the small blush that has infused her cheeks. Before, her hair had hidden the fact that she is bare-breasted. Now she has nothing but her arms to hide her partial nakedness)~
@1796 = ~Ummmm... maybe it would be better if you did this yourself.~
@1797 = ~Fade, I promise I won't look, okay? I'm here to help, not to ogle.~
@1798 = ~Yes, maybe it's for the best. I think I can do this on my own. Thanks for your help, <CHARNAME>... I really appreciate it.~
@1799 = ~(Reluctantly, she holds her arms out so you can bandage her back. You turn your head, trying to be true to your word, but you cannot help but notice that her breasts are shapely. You feel your cheeks redden as you place your arms around her and begin to bandage her. When you have finished, she drops her arms and her lips slowly curl into a slightly awkward smile)~
@1800 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I couldn't have done this without you. I think I can do the rest on my own now.~
@1801 = ~As long as you're sure. Sleep well, Fade.~
@1802 = ~No, it's okay. I'll help you with the rest.~
@1803 = ~I think I will, now. Sleep well too, <CHARNAME>.~
@1804 = ~(You get a fresh cloth and begin to gently cleanse the injuries on her face. Fade sighs and places a gentle hand on your cheek)~
@1805 = ~I really don't deserve your help, <CHARNAME>. After all I have put you through today, I would have thought this was the *last* thing you would have wanted to do. Why... why did you come and rescue me?~
@1806 = ~Because I had to. I've become quite... fond of you, Fade.~
@1807 = ~Well, I couldn't leave you there, could I?~
@1808 = ~(Her one good eye widens slightly, and a smile curls at the corners of her lips) And I've become quite... fond of you too, <CHARNAME>.~
@1809 = ~Well... you could have.~
@1810 = ~No, I couldn't. I've become... quite fond of you, Fade.~
@1811 = ~No, I couldn't. Friends don't leave friends behind.~
@1812 = ~Yes, that's true. Friends don't leave friends behind... ~
@1813 = ~(You decide to take time out to relax and have a drink, something none of you normally have time for. Fade decides to grasp this opportunity with both hands and ends up drinking more than is possibly wise)~
@1814 = ~(After spending the last half hour watching her standing on a table singing bawdy songs with an even more inebriated group of dwarves she seems to have befriended, you marvel at her apparent ability to be at home in almost any company, even though she is technically an Outsider)~
@1815 = ~(She soon notices you watching her, however, and grinning rather stupidly at you, she wends her way over to you, a mug of ale in one hand, and deposits herself in your lap, flinging her arms around your neck) 'Ello <CHARNAME>... ~
@1816 = ~Hello, Fade. Don't you think you've had enough?~
@1817 = ~Hello, Fade. I see you're having fun. (wrap your arms around her waist)~
@1818 = ~Get off me, you drunken fool. Go and pester someone else.~
@1819 = ~(Her grin widens and she shakes her head) I have only jusht starteded *hic* 'scuse me... Come on, <CHARNAME>! Join me innalittledrinkie... it's good for what ails youse.~
@1820 = ~OI! BARKEEP! A little drinkie here for my mostest esteemeded an' gorgeoustest boyfriend here.~
@1821 = ~Okay, I'll have a drink with you. But you must promise then that you'll slow down. You'll only regret it in the morning.~
@1822 = ~(grin) Most esteemed and gorgeous boyfriend, eh?~
@1823 = ~No, Fade. I don't really drink and I really think you've had enough. Come on, give me that mug.~
@1824 = ~(She nods her head enthusiastically) Them dwarvseses know how to drink! Theys bin buyin' me this. (She thrusts her mug of ale under your nose--it smells strong. She taps the side of her nose conspiratorially, missing it a few times)~
@1825 = ~Between you an' me I think that it tashtes like cat piss, but youcan'tberude to the dwarvseseses. Theys very proud of their catsh piss. *hic* I mean alesh. You wanna wanna drink?~
@1826 = ~(sigh) Okay, Fade, I'll have a drink with you. Just slow down, all right? Otherwise you're totally going to regret this in the morning.~
@1827 = ~No, Fade, please stop drinking now. I don't really drink, so I really don't want one, and I think you've had enough now. Give me that mug.~
@1828 = ~Oooooooooooh! 'm a drunkenen fool, am I? Well, I'm sure that pretty beer wench over there or that rather deliciousus bardbloke will appreciate my *hic* drunkenen foolness!~
@1829 = ~(She strikes a pose, one finger in the air) But firstly! 'm goin' t'go an' get anotherlittledrinkie! (She gets up off your lap and wobbles away from you)~
@1830 = ~Wha'? Mornin'? Oh, sod th'mornin'. Live life for the now, <CHARNAME>!~
@1831 = ~(The barkeep sends over a serving girl to your table. Fade leans back in your lap to get a good look at her. The serving girl smiles rather wearily at the two of you and asks you what you want. Fade grins at the girl in an alarmingly seductive manner) You're ver' pretty, y'know. I bets you gots thighs as soft as silk, haven't you... ~
@1832 = ~Fade!! There really is no need for that! (to the serving girl) Please ignore my friend. She really has no head for ale, and she didn't mean it, I'm sure.~
@1833 = ~(try to put your hand over Fade's mouth to shut her up) Please, just ignore her. I'll have a glass of wine, thank you.~
@1834 = ~(try to stifle a laugh) Fade! You can't speak to people like that, it's not very nice. (to the serving girl) I'll have whatever it is she's drinking.~
@1835 = ~(She giggles and covers her mouth with her hand, a rather endearingly girlish gesture) I can pay y'a complimenent if I wants to, <CHARNAME>. (She leans forward in your lap, wraps her arms around your neck and rests her head on your shoulder)~
@1836 = ~(After a short while, the barkeep sends over a serving girl, who smiles rather wearily at you both and asks you what you want. At this, Fade looks up at her) I'll be havin' of more of your lovelely ale.~
@1837 = ~(She leans closer to the serving girl, and mock-whispers at her) You're ver' pretty, y'know. But no matterer how pretty y'are, y' canna be havin' this one. (She leans forward again and clasps you to her breast) 'cos this one's mine!~
@1838 = ~(snuggle up against her cleavage with a self satisfied smile) I'll have what ever she's drinking.~
@1839 = ~(disentangle yourself from her) No, I'm not yours, Fade, not while you're drunk. Other times, maybe, but not now. I'm going to bed.~
@1840 = ~(She leaps up from your lap, holding the mug out of your reach) You want it? Come an' get it!~
@1841 = ~(She pokes her tongue out at you, and with a flick of her tail, runs back off to her new dwarven friends. You hear them cheer when she rejoins them, and decide that, even after all you've been through, you really don't want to face a group of drunken dwarves with an inebriated Fey'ri in tow!)~
@1842 = ~(She covers her mouth with her hand and tries to stifle a giggle) Oh, I'm a baaaad girl! I'm in troububble now... (the serving girl just shakes her head and leaves)~
@1843 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... jus' lightenen up a bit. (She takes a gulp from her mug) Thas' th'problem withpeoplelikeyou... don't know when 'm jokin' an' when 'm bein' sheriousus. 'm not jus' a pair of fantastictitsonlegsh, y'know... ~
@1844 = ~WHAT? Where did that one come from? What are you talking about?~
@1845 = ~(sigh) Whatever, Fade, whatever. I definitely think you've had enough of that now. (try to pluck the drink from her hand)~
@1846 = ~(As you place your hand over her mouth, you feel her grin, and as you are speaking, you feel her start licking and nibbling the inside of your hand. The serving girl just nods and leaves to get your order)~
@1847 = ~Ewww! Fade, don't do that. It's disgusting. I really do think you've had enough of that. (try to grab her ale mug)~
@1848 = ~(pull her closer to you) If you're going to do things like that, don't do them to my hand... ~
@1849 = ~(remove your hand from her mouth) Come on, Fade, stop messing around. I think it's time you said goodnight to all the nice people here and went to bed.~
@1850 = ~(Fade waggles her eyebrows suggestively at you and then wraps her arms around your neck) Am I a bad girl then, <CHARNAME>?~
@1851 = ~Oh yes, Fade. Very bad. In fact, I feel punishment may be in order... (lean forward and kiss her)~
@1852 = ~(disentangle yourself from her) Yes, you are, and I think you've had enough by now. I think you should go and say goodnight to all your new friends and go to bed, okay?~
@1853 = ~(She looks down at you and grins) You like it there? Wouldn'n't it betterer here? (She places her fingers under your chin to tilt your head up to her face)~
@1854 = ~Possibly... (lean forward and allow her to kiss you)~
@1855 = ~(disentangle yourself from her) Maybe, but I think you've had enough now and I think you should go and say goodnight to all your new friends and go to bed, okay?~
@1856 = ~Suit y'self! But 'm goin' t'go an' get anotherlittledrinkie! (She gets up off your lap and wobbles away from you)~
@1857 = ~(She leans back in your lap so her back is against the table and rests her ankles on your shoulders) It's jus' that peoples see that'm a part succubus an' they asss... asus... amus... think tha'm nothin' more'n a play thing for theirownpleasure.~
@1858 = ~(She sticks her finger in her ale and begins to play with the foam. After a few seconds, she with draws her finger and puts it in her mouth, seemingly oblivious to how suggestive this may seem to onlookers)~
@1859 = ~Fade, you're not doing much to counteract that image at the moment. Maybe you should just go and say goodnight to all the nice people and go to bed.~
@1860 = ~(She gives you a slightly sly look and nods. You are almost suspicious at her compliance, but she stands up, bows and wishes everyone a rather slurred goodnight. Many of the patrons bid her goodnight back, and the dwarves begin to whoop, calling her "lightweight". She just grins at them, and takes you by the hand)~
@1861 = ~Okay then. But you're goin' to havta help me... ~
@1862 = ~No, Fade, you can find your own way up to bed. I'm not tired now. Go on.~
@1863 = ~Okay.~
@1864 = ~(She responds hungrily, and you feel her tail wrap itself around your leg. She shifts slightly forwards so that her entire body is pressed against yours. After a while your hear a drunken dwarven voice shout "Get a room, you two!" and lots of hearty laughter)~
@1865 = ~Want to take their advice?~
@1866 = ~(ignore them and continue to kiss her)~
@1867 = ~(She nods and takes your hand)~
@1868 = ~(After a while, you realize that she is flagging--her alcohol consumption is obviously catching up with her. As you break apart, she tries to stifle a yawn)~
@1869 = ~Come on. Maybe you should go to bed now.~
@1870 = ~You push her in the direction of the stairs, and despite her sleepy protestations, she eventually begins to stumble her way up them. You decide to just leave her be.~
@1871 = ~(You get to your room, and as you fumble with the key, Fade begins to kiss the back of your neck, distracting you somewhat from the task at hand. Eventually you get the key turned in the lock, and both fall into the room together, Fade giggling as she lands on top of you)~
@1872 = ~(You both get up and stagger over to the bed, Fade because she is drunk, you because you are bearing most of her weight. She continues to kiss you for a while, and teases you by nibbling your shoulders and running her hand up your inner thigh)~
@1873 = ~(let her continue)~
@1874 = ~Fade, you're drunk. I'm not about to take advantage of that. Just lie down and rest.~
@1875 = ~(You end up in a mini wrestling match, and the drunk Fey'ri is no match for you. She just spends the entire time trying alternately to kiss and tickle you. As you begin to unlace her tunic, she yawns hugely, and her eyes begin to droop--you know that no matter what you do, she is going to fall into a trance)~
@1876 = ~(Shaking your head in amusement and, you have to admit to yourself, slight disappointment, you cover her up and crawl in beside her. She fidgets slightly, trying to get comfortable, and pulls your arm around her waist, so you are cuddled up against her back. You then close your eyes and decide now would be a good time to get some rest any way)~
@1877 = ~(She lies back on the bed in what could be considered a rather seductive pose, if her eyelids did not keep drooping closed. After a few seconds of struggling to remain awake, she finally gives in to her urge to trance)~
@1878 = ~(You awaken to the dulcet sounds of someone being sick out of the window) No... no more... there isn't anything left... urrggh... ~
@1879 = ~(whisper) Serve you right!~
@1880 = ~Are you alright?~
@1881 = ~What did I say last night? I've got no sympathy for you!~
@1882 = ~(Get up and go over to her) Awww... poor baby.~
@1883 = ~I know you're awake. Go and get me a glass of water and... oh no... uurrrghhh... ~
@1884 = ~Nope, can't hear you. Anyway, I'm asleep.~
@1885 = ~No... It feels like a pig shat in my head.~
@1886 = ~Nice mental picture, Fade. Thanks for that. You want anything?~
@1887 = ~Please, the last thing I need now is... ulp... (takes some deep breaths) ... no, no, I'm okay... a lecture! I feel terrible enough already.~
@1888 = ~(Get up and go over to her) Aww... poor baby. Come to <CHARNAME>.~
@1889 = ~So you're not going to want any breakfast either?~
@1890 = ~(grin) I know something that'll make you feel better... ~
@1891 = ~Oh, ha ha. Don't be so bloody sarcastic. I really do feel... oohh... quite... ulp... dreadfu... (She leans out of the window again to be sick)~
@1892 = ~(sigh) That's right, get it all up. Maybe next time you'll think twice before challenging some dwarves to a drinking competition, eh?~
@1893 = ~I can cope with blood and gore, but sick? Sorry, Fade, but you're on your own!~
@1894 = ~Bastard... It feels like a pig shat in my head.~
@1895 = ~To die now, painlessly. Uuurrrggg... I'm NEVER drinking again, ever! (She leans out of the window to be sick again)~
@1896 = ~No!~
@1897 = ~So, you don't want some lovely, crispy bacon, topped with a deliciously oozing runny egg, with yolk just dripping?~
@1898 = ~That's okay then, I can eat yours!~
@1899 = ~Well, if that's the case, I know something that'll make you feel better... ~
@1900 = ~And is this "something" the same "something" that you claim to be the miracle cure for all headaches, back pain and stomach cramps too?~
@1901 = ~Heh heh... yep! <CHARNAME>'s magic wand, cures what ails you!~
@1902 = ~Well, it would take your mind off being ill.~
@1903 = ~Yes... bloody dwarves... all their fault!~
@1904 = ~Hmmm. Because they held you down and just threw the drink down your throat, didn't they?~
@1905 = ~Yes, dear, of course it is.~
@1906 = ~Bloody coward. (sigh) Go on then. I'll be okay in a bit. Go, have some breakfast and get ready, I should be alright by then.~
@1907 = ~Bastard! (She throws up out of the window again) Please... if you're going to talk about food, just bugger off and do it elsewhere. I don't think I can cope.~
@1908 = ~(sigh) Okay, I was only teasing. Maybe next time you'll think *twice* before challenging some dwarves to a drinking competition, eh?~
@1909 = ~Okay, okay, I'll go! Just make sure you're alright to travel in a bit. We can't stop here all day.~
@1910 = ~Yes, you can eat mine. Go on, off you go. I'll be okay in a bit. Go, have some breakfast and get ready, I should be alright by then.~
@1911 = ~You just don't give up, do you?! <CHARNAME>, believe me, that is the *last* thing on my mind at the moment. Anyway, there's a very good chance I'd be sick on you, and I don't think you'd appreciate that.~
@1912 = ~(nuzzle the back of her neck) Sure I can't change your mind?~
@1913 = ~Eww... maybe you do have a point. Perhaps I'll go and get myself something to eat instead.~
@1914 = ~No it wouldn't! I just want to crawl into bed and die, not crawl into bed and be jumped by you! (grin) Well, not this time, anyway.~
@1915 = ~Ahhh. Maybe later then?~
@1916 = ~Well, at least I got a smile out of you. Perhaps I'll go get myself something to eat and see you later?~
@1917 = ~Oh, I wondered when you'd say that. Okay, okay, I've only got myself to blame! Still, bloody dwarves... Look, why don't you go and get ready and get yourself something to eat? I should be okay by then. Just get me a glass of water!~
@1918 = ~Oh, don't be so insufferably agreeable, <CHARNAME>. Go on, make yourself useful. Go and get me a glass of water, then go and get ready and get yourself something to eat. I should be okay by then.~
@1919 = ~Yes, yes, yes, point taken. Get me a glass of water, then go and get ready and get yourself something to eat. I should be okay by then.~
@1920 = ~(laugh) You're incorrigible! No, you can't change my mind. Go on, my horny champion. Go and get me a glass of water, then go and get ready and get yourself something to eat. I should be okay by then.~
@1921 = ~Yes, that's a good idea. Go and get ready and get yourself something to eat. I should be okay by then.~
@1922 = ~Okay, <CHARNAME>... maybe later. Now go and get me a glass of water, then go and get ready and get yourself something to eat. I should be okay by then.~
@1923 = ~(Fade shivers and looks around her a little apprehensively)~
@1924 = ~Are you all right... Mistress?~
@1925 = ~(ignore her)~
@1926 = ~(She nods, but does not smile) I am reminded too much of many things I do not wish to remember, here. This place reeks of the Abyss, of despair, of hatred and of greed. But I am fine.~
@1927 = ~(whisper) As long as you are sure. Just don't blow our cover, okay?~
@1928 = ~(whisper) What do you mean?~
@1929 = ~(whisper) Fade, I'm warning you, no silly outbursts. Just do as you're told for once. I cannot afford for our ruse to be uncovered. Do I make myself clear?~
@1930 = ~Come here... male. I need to speak with you.~
@1931 = ~Are you alright... Mistress?~
@1932 = ~Male? Who the hell are you calling "male"?~
@1933 = ~You presume to tell me how to behave in a place such as this?~
@1934 = ~(quietly) And I thought you trusted me. I will not betray you, Veldrin, by deed or by comment. It would mean both our deaths.~
@1935 = ~(whisper) I didn't mean to admonish you, Fade. It's just that you can get a bit, well, passionate about things you don't like. But you're right. I do trust you, and I know you won't betray our secret. Come on, we have much to do here.~
@1936 = ~(whisper) Exactly. That's why I need you to behave yourself. No silly outbursts; just do as you're told for once. I cannot afford for our ruse to be uncovered. Do I make myself clear?~
@1937 = ~(whisper) What do you mean about behaving in a place like this?~
@1938 = ~Not here. Order a room, where we can speak in private, away from watchful eyes and ears.~
@1939 = ~(She looks away from you, giving all the drow in the tavern an imperious, defiant look, as if daring them to comment)~
@1940 = ~I shall do that, Mistress.~
@1941 = ~But Mistress, maybe it would be better to tell me now, if it is so important... ~
@1942 = ~Perfectly. (She raises her voice slightly) Now get out of my sight.~
@1943 = ~(She glares at you, and you have no choice but to obey)~
@1944 = ~(hiss) Remember where we are! (loudly) Do as I say, male!~
@1945 = ~Yes... Mistress. (quietly) Are you alright?~
@1946 = ~I really need to speak with you, Veldrin. Order a room, where we can speak in private, away from watchful eyes and ears.~
@1947 = ~You dare question me? Then it is unimportant. (She raises her voice slightly) Now get out of my sight.~
@1948 = ~(When you enter the room, she quickly locks the door behind you, and then listens closely, obviously worried someone will be listening)~
@1949 = ~Fade, is that entirely necessary? I don't think anyone will disturb us.~
@1950 = ~So, what did you mean earlier?~
@1951 = ~I'm afraid it is. The drow are not unlike the Fey'ri... and the Fey'ri are a traitorous, paranoid lot. If any of the drow here suspects anything, anything at all, and they think it will benefit their house... (sigh) We are in real danger here, <CHARNAME>.~
@1952 = ~Thanks for pointing out the obvious, Fade. I had no idea. Now what did you mean earlier?~
@1953 = ~I know. The sooner we are out of here, the better, but we have to play along, just until we get the eggs. What did you mean earlier?~
@1954 = ~(She sits down on the bed, and you sit next to her) Once upon a time I would have relished being here. I might even have been tolerated... the Fey'ri and the drow have been known to co-operate in the past. Well, maybe not co-operate. I don't think that's a word either race totally understands. We would *use* each other.~
@1955 = ~(She picks absent-mindedly at the fringe of the blanket covering the bed) You know, neither the Fey'ri nor the drow have a word for "alliance". The nearest word in Abyssal loosely translates as "conspiracy", or "requirement".~
@1956 = ~It's the same with the drow. At least they have a word that roughly translates as "friend". We don't even have one of those. We have mate, supplicant, superior, inferior, slave... ~
@1957 = ~This place... it's too much like the Citadel. Its atmosphere, its inhabitants... the haughty, empty and cruel cast of that drow female's eyes... the hopeless, impotent anger in the male... it's all so familiar to me. Cruelty and gratification for their own sake... ~
@1958 = ~It's almost too much to bear! The temptation to raise the whip... to command... to lose oneself in the frenzy of physicality in whatever guise you seek it... I do not wish to go there again!~
@1959 = ~But my blood rebels... the fiendish side of me sits up and begs to be let loose here, even in this drow disguise. But to do that would be to lose myself again... to forget... to dishonour... ~
@1960 = ~You must help me, <CHARNAME>! I cannot lose myself... ~
@1961 = ~(wrap her in a hug) I will not allow it to happen, Fade. Together we will fight, okay? Be strong.~
@1962 = ~(wrap her in a hug) I didn't realise... I thought such a place would disgust you, but I guess I understand. You have to be strong, for both our sakes. I will try to help you in whatever way I can.~
@1963 = ~What are you on about, Fade?! You're tempted by this place? You're crazy, did you know that? Absolutely crazy! I should have left you back in Athkatla, with your Shadow Thief cronies. Just stay away from me from now on, okay?~
@1964 = ~Who said you would lose yourself? You gave up your heritage... maybe your blood is willing you to reclaim it. You should be proud of what you are, Fade, and embrace your more... demonic qualities. I can see you want to... I can see the fire there, in your eyes. (whisper) You can use me... ~
@1965 = ~(As you speak, she begins to caress the back of your neck, and then nibbles your shoulder, swinging one leg over you so she is sitting in your lap. Her intention is obvious)~
@1966 = ~(push her off roughly) Fade, what the hell are you playing at?!?~
@1967 = ~(disentangle yourself from her) Fade, no. This isn't you. Please? Not as drow. We'll only regret it.~
@1968 = ~(allow her to carry on)~
@1969 = ~(You storm out of the room, and the last thing you see before the door swings shut is the look of mingled pain, shock and despair on Fade's face)~
@1970 = ~(Her eyes darken, and she roughly pushes you back on the bed and straddles you, trapping your arms under her knees. She then pulls out a dagger and leans over you, running the dagger's blade slowly down your tunic, cutting through the laces)~
@1971 = ~(As your eyes meet hers, her former lustful visage is replaced by one of horror, and she sits up abruptly with a cry, releasing your arms, and flings the dagger away from her) No! I will NOT give in!~
@1972 = ~(scramble away from her) Are you crazy? Give in? What in the Nine Hells were you going to do then? I just thought that... that... ~
@1973 = ~(grab her wrists) Come on, Fade. You know you want to.~
@1974 = ~(Her eyes flare with momentary anger, and you wonder if she will attack you there and then for denying her. She then shakes her head, and when she speaks, her voice is dismayed and desperate)~
@1975 = ~I can't help it, <CHARNAME>! I'm sorry... This is why you have to help me. It's almost too much for me... I'm trying to resist, but it gnaws at me so... ~
@1976 = ~(She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes) I must be strong. You're right. But I can't do it alone... ~
@1977 = ~I said I'd help you, Fade, and I will. I'm sorry I pushed you. I didn't realise that your... compulsion was so strong. We'll stay here for now, so you can calm down. Everything will be better once you've rested.~
@1978 = ~Well, you're going to have to! You're crazy, did you know that? Absolutely crazy! I should have left you back in Athkatla, with your Shadow Thief cronies. Just stay away from me from now on, okay?~
@1979 = ~I'll help you, Fade, but I want it made quite plain that I have no intention of ever giving in to you. I don't know what instincts you are acting on at the moment, but I'm not interested, okay?~
@1980 = ~(Her eyes flare with momentary anger at being denied, but is soon replaced by a look of resignation) You're right, <CHARNAME>. (sigh) I probably would have ended up killing you if you let me carry on... I can't help it in this place.~
@1981 = ~I have to be strong, I have to fight it... but I can't do it alone, that much must be obvious to you now. Please, you have to help me.~
@1982 = ~I said I'd help you Fade, and I will. I didn't realise that your... compulsion was so strong. We'll stay here for now, so you can calm down. Everything will be better once you've rested. Trust me.~
@1983 = ~You would have killed me? Why?~
@1984 = ~(She begins to slowly unlace her tunic, but as her eyes meet yours, she stops and shakes her head, looking confused) No... this is wrong... wrong. Not as drow... ~
@1985 = ~What? No! Don't stop now!~
@1986 = ~You're right. Not as drow. We would only end up regretting it. I said I'd help you Fade, and I will. Come on, we'll rest here for now, so we can both calm down. It'll be better once we've rested, I'm sure of it.~
@1987 = ~You thought what? That you'd get a bit of gratification out of me, and that would be it? <CHARNAME>, I'm part succubus! You may not die if I kiss you, but if I let go... if I let that side of me take over... who knows what would happen?~
@1988 = ~This place isn't healthy for me! I don't know whether I want to mate with you or rip you into little bits!~
@1989 = ~You're crazy, did you know that? Absolutely crazy! I should have left you back in Athkatla, with your Shadow Thief cronies. Just stay away from me from now on, okay?~
@1990 = ~Is it that bad? Okay, I'll help you, even if it's just to stop you from ripping my heart out! Come on, we'll rest here for now, so we can both calm down. It'll be better once we've rested, I'm sure of it.~
@1991 = ~No!! You think this will be a simple act of gratification? <CHARNAME>, I'm part succubus! You may not die if I kiss you, but if I let go... if I let that side of me take over... who knows what would happen?~
@1992 = ~What? I didn't... Okay, I'll help you, even if it's just to stop you from ripping my heart out! Come on, we'll rest here for now, so we can both calm down. It'll be better once we've rested, I'm sure of it.~
@1993 = ~(keep hold of her wrists and pull her closer) I don't believe you, Fade.~
@1994 = ~Yes, rest... but keep yourself safe. I want you to promise... if I get out of hand, if I give in and become a danger... you will kill me. I can't live like that again.~
@1995 = ~Of course, Fade. But it will never come to that, trust me. Now rest.~
@1996 = ~Fade, I can't promise that. I can't kill you. I'll compromise, though. If it happens, and only if, I'll knock you out until we get back to the surface, okay? No arguing. Now rest.~
@1997 = ~(A look of dismay crosses her face) Yes, <CHARNAME>... I understand. (She turns away from you and lies on the bed, as if preparing to trance, and says nothing more)~
@1998 = ~(sigh) I'm part succubus, <CHARNAME>. You may not die if I kiss you, but if I let go... if I let that side of me take over... who knows what would happen?~
@1999 = ~This place isn't healthy for me. I don't know whether I want to mate with you or rip you into little bits! I'm possibly not... safe to be around at the moment.~
@2000 = ~(She wrenches her wrists from you and jumps off the bed) No... No! Everything... it's over, <CHARNAME>, possibly even before it began, but it's *over*! I can't believe you want me to become... to allow that side of me to prevail... just for your own pleasure?! Not that you would have been able to have handled me in any way!!~
@2001 = ~(She unlocks the door, wrenches it open and storms off)~
@2002 = ~(As you settle down, Fade sits on the end of your bed, her knees tucked up under her chin) <CHARNAME>, this isn't good.~
@2003 = ~Understatement of the year, Fade.~
@2004 = ~I know.~
@2005 = ~Fade, what are we going to do?~
@2006 = ~I know. (She pauses and seems to stare at the wall for a while) <CHARNAME>, does this predicament frighten you at all? Or is it just me?~
@2007 = ~You're... scared?~
@2008 = ~Yes, it does, and no, it isn't just you. Here we are, in the last place on all of Faerun we want to be... I'm sorry, Fade. I never meant to put you in such danger. I should never have taken you along with me.~
@2009 = ~This predicament worries me, Fade, but we just have to stay strong and work through it. Everything will be alright. It has to be.~
@2010 = ~"I know"? Is that all you're going to say? I don't know about you, <CHARNAME>, but this whole situation... worries me somewhat. Doesn't it worry you?~
@2011 = ~(She looks to you, and with a gentle smile, sits closer to you) We're going to work it out, that's what we're going to do. (She lays a hand on your shoulder) I'm worried too, but we will be okay. We have to be okay.~
@2012 = ~But how can you be so sure? Here we are, in the last place on all of Faerun we want to be... I'm sorry, Fade. I never meant to put you in such danger. I should never have taken you along with me.~
@2013 = ~Yes, you're right. It's just another challenge to face. We'll be fine.~
@2014 = ~Aren't you scared?~
@2015 = ~A bit. It's hard to stay optimistic down here in the dark, knowing that we are in possibly the most dangerous place on all Faerun.~
@2016 = ~(gesture her towards your open arms) Come here.~
@2017 = ~Just try to see it as another challenge to face, and we'll be fine.~
@2018 = ~<CHARNAME>, don't say that. Don't blame yourself--there was nothing you could have done to prevent this situation.~
@2019 = ~(She sits next to you, places an arm around your shoulders and rests her head atop yours) Everything will be okay. You look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2020 = ~Yes, you're right.~
@2021 = ~I really hope so, <CHARNAME>.~
@2022 = ~(She sits next to you, places an arm around your shoulders and rests her head atop yours) Everything will be okay--it has to be. You look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2023 = ~<CHARNAME>, don't say that. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else--because I'm with you. Please don't blame yourself. There was nothing you could have done to prevent this situation.~
@2024 = ~(She sits next to you, places an arm around your shoulders, kisses you and rests her head atop yours) Everything will be okay. Now you look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2025 = ~(She sits next to you, places an arm around your shoulders, kisses you and rests her head atop yours) Everything will be okay, because we are together. Now you look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2026 = ~(She sits next to you, places an arm around your shoulders, kisses you and rests her head atop yours) Everything will be okay--it has to be. You look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2027 = ~(She gives you a grateful smile and moves closer to you, nestling her head against your shoulder, wrapping her arms around you) I know everything will be okay--it has to be. You look absolutely shattered. Just... try to rest. I'll stay here and watch for you, just in case.~
@2028 = ~(You wake up groggily after being mind-blasted by the illithid. As you pick yourself up and look to see if your companions are unharmed, your gaze rests on Fade. The Fey'ri is huddled in the corner, hugging her knees, her crimson eyes wide. She seems to be rocking slightly, muttering the same phrase over again in a guttural language you don't understand. You can only assume it is Abyssal)~
@2029 = ~(leave her be)~
@2030 = ~(stretch out your hand and touch her shoulder) Fade, are you all right?~
@2031 = ~(As your hand rests on her shoulder, she jumps, her eyes wild) Mind flayers! We've been captured by Mind flayers... Mind flayers... Mind flayers... ~
@2032 = ~Fade, calm down. We'll be okay.~
@2033 = ~Okay, Fade, you... err... have an insane moment in the corner, then. I'll be over... uh, there.~
@2034 = ~Okay? Okay?? You do know what mind flayers do, don't you? They turn you into slaves... into thralls... we're all going to be slaves!~
@2035 = ~Fade, pull yourself together! We are NOT going to be turned into thralls. We are NOT going to be slaves.~
@2036 = ~(pull her to you and hug her)~
@2037 = ~(She ignores you and continues to mutter to herself for a while. Suddenly she looks your way and whispers) I can't handle being a slave again, <CHARNAME>... I can't be a thrall!~
@2038 = ~(You cup her chin in your hand, making her look at you. You can feel her trembling through your hand--she is absolutely terrified) How can you be so sure?~
@2039 = ~Fade, I promise you, we will get out of this. You will never be a slave again, okay? I won't allow it. Please, try to calm down. Come on... breathe with me... ~
@2040 = ~Because I have no intention of letting my tale end here, Fade. So come on, now. I need you to be strong. Calm down and help me think about how we are going to get out of here.~
@2041 = ~(She accepts your embrace the same way a frightened child would--by clinging on to you as fiercely as she can. Her breathing is quick and shallow, and you can feel her heart thundering against her rib cage)~
@2042 = ~Please, Fade, try to calm down. We'll get out of this, I promise. You'll never have to be a slave again. Come on... breathe with me... ~
@2043 = ~(You feel her try to nod, and try to settle her breathing by imitating you. Her eyes never leave you face, and she seems to draw strength from your calm demeanor) Yes, we will be fine.~
@2044 = ~(She tries to smile, but it comes out as a twisted grimace. She is obviously still frightened, but you now know you will be able to count on her if necessary)~
@2045 = ~(She nods and sits down opposite you, studying your face, and she seems to draw strength from your calm demeanor) Yes, let us think about how we will get out.~
@2046 = ~<CHARNAME>. May I ask you a question?~
@2047 = ~Of course, Fade. What is it?~
@2048 = ~Can you ask me later? Now is not really a good time.~
@2049 = ~No. You're not here to ask questions, and I'm not here to answer them. Fall back into line.~
@2050 = ~It's just that... I have heard much of your previous exploits in Baldur's Gate. How you averted a war and everything. Is it... all true?~
@2051 = ~Yes. All of it is true. I also solved the problem of the iron shortage, stopped major bandit activity in the area... everything.~
@2052 = ~Well, I don't know exactly what you've heard, but yes, I did avert a war... but I couldn't have done it without the help of my companions. They deserve as much of an accolade as I do.~
@2053 = ~What? If you've heard of what happened, why are you asking me? Yes, I did everything they say I did. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to more important things than answering stupid questions.~
@2054 = ~Well, depending on what you've heard... it's all true. It wasn't easy though. Many people forget how many of my loved ones and companions died during that time. It's not all glory.~
@2055 = ~(She raises an eyebrow and grins) *All* of it is true? Even the story where you're 17 feet tall and skewered 10 men at once with one thrust of your mighty lance?~
@2056 = ~(smile) Yes, things are made so much easier when you have loyal... friends... around you. Still, your accomplishments are quite... heroic, if you don't mind me saying so.~
@2057 = ~Oh, I don't know about heroic. Things had to be done. I couldn't just stand there and let everything fall down around my ears. So much was at stake... ~
@2058 = ~Thank you for the compliment, but the way you said "friends"... it's as if you haven't had much of a chance to use the word before.~
@2059 = ~I see. I was going to congratulate you on your accomplishments, but I see your head is already swollen enough. I am sorry to have... bothered you with such trivial matters.~
@2060 = ~Yes, I have to agree with you. People tend to forget the great cost one has to pay when undertaking such tasks... all that is remembered is the glory.~
@2061 = ~(She lays a hand on your arm) I am sorry for your loss.~
@2062 = ~That's all right. Although I sometimes feel their loss acutely, life must go on. Sitting and brooding about the dead doesn't bring them back, nor does it do their memory any favours.~
@2063 = ~(snatch your hand away) I do not wish to discuss my former companions with you, Fade. You are here to assist me, not probe my inner psyche. Do not bother me with such trivial matters again.~
@2064 = ~(cover her hand with yours) We all love and lose, Fade. And unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it, no matter who we are.~
@2065 = ~(grin) I'm sorry... I couldn't resist! Still, even after picking through some of the more... fantastic versions of your exploits, they are still quite extraordinary.~
@2066 = ~But then again, I suppose you couldn't be anything less, if rumours about your apparent heritage are to be believed... ~
@2067 = ~I suppose you're right. Being a child of Bhaal certainly makes life a bit more interesting.~
@2068 = ~Please forgive my defensive stance, Fade. It's just... let's just say people aren't always so complimentary.~
@2069 = ~(laugh) Yes, people have said that, and more! They also speak of your... apparent heritage.~
@2070 = ~And what do they say?~
@2071 = ~There's no need to be bashful, <CHARNAME>. You have much to be proud of. You have achieved so much--people respect you, even though they know of your... apparent heritage.~
@2072 = ~And why should people not respect me? I am a child of Bhaal. I cannot help it.~
@2073 = ~Was that a compliment or an insult, Fade? I know people sometimes find the fact that I'm a child of Bhaal hard to swallow, but it's their problem, not mine. Does it bother you?~
@2074 = ~Yes... although much of that is probably due to the rumours surrounding your heritage, don't you think? What would you pick, a lowly ranger or cleric? Or the child of the dead Lord of Murder?~
@2075 = ~I... I... ~
@2076 = ~I can only agree with you there, <CHARNAME>. Many would say that such sentiments would be incomprehensible to one of your apparent heritage, but I am glad they are wrong.~
@2077 = ~And why would they say that? I may be a child of Bhaal, but that doesn't mean I don't have feelings.~
@2078 = ~I'm glad you can see that... and that my being a child of Bhaal doesn't bother you.~
@2079 = ~(She seems to stare at your hand for a while, as if she is unsure of how to react. You then feel her fingers tighten slightly on your arm)~
@2080 = ~I... I can only agree with you there, <CHARNAME>. Many would say that such sentiments would be incomprehensible to one of your apparent heritage, but I am glad they are wrong.~
@2081 = ~That... that you are a child of Bhaal, the dead Lord of Murder. Is it true?~
@2082 = ~Ahh, so we get back to that, do we? Well, I'm not prepared to discuss it with you, Fade. Not now, not ever. Understand?~
@2083 = ~So you... admit your heritage? I was quite worried about mentioning it, in case you... in case... ~
@2084 = ~In case I denied it and got angry? Don't worry, Fade. Unless of course it bothers you.~
@2085 = ~No, it doesn't. I feel honoured to travel with you, to be part of your adventure.~
@2086 = ~And I'm glad to have you with me.~
@2087 = ~Well, so you should. Now we really must get on.~
@2088 = ~Rumours, mainly. So... it's true, then?~
@2089 = ~I... I feel honoured to travel with you, to be a part of your adventure. And I feel even more honoured now you consider me a friend.~
@2090 = ~I'm glad to have you with me. And the honour is all mine.~
@2091 = ~(smile) All right, all right. I won't press the issue if you don't want me to. For now, anyway.~
@2092 = ~Fair enough. I only wished to discuss your past, but I suppose it can wait.~
@2093 = ~Hang on... what do you mean? What have you heard?~
@2094 = ~You're right. It can wait. I do not wish to discuss my past with you, Fade. Ever.~
@2095 = ~I only wished to ask you about your past... but I can see you are above such trivial matters.~
@2096 = ~You're right, I am above such trivial matters. I do not wish to discuss my past with you, Fade. Ever.~
@2097 = ~That's... very good to hear, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~
@2098 = ~<CHARNAME>, is there something you want to ask me? I've seen you giving me puzzled looks a lot recently--what is on your mind?~
@2099 = ~Actually, I just... well, I don't want to be rude, but... why *do* you have a tail? If that isn't too personal a question, of course.~
@2100 = ~Nothing to worry about. It's simply that you aren't quite like other elves I've met before.~
@2101 = ~Okay then. It's just that... well, you have a tail. Obviously I noticed it as soon as we met, but... ~
@2102 = ~I wondered when you would ask me that, <CHARNAME>... and no, I don't mind at all. I'm from a race of elves known as the Fey'ri.~
@2103 = ~That's because I'm not like other elves. I'm a Fey'ri. Do you... know what a Fey'ri is?~
@2104 = ~Yes, of course I do. The Fey'ri are elves with demonic blood. I never thought I'd meet one, thought.~
@2105 = ~(smile) And you didn't know how to approach me about it? Many people say that. I have a tail because I am a Fey'ri. Do you know what a Fey'ri is?~
@2106 = ~No, I don't.~
@2107 = ~Yes, actually, I have heard of your people. I did wonder... I never actually thought I'd ever meet one.~
@2108 = ~The Fey'ri are a race of Sun elves who have... Tan'ari ancestors. We hail from the Hellgate in the High Forest to the north.~
@2109 = ~My grandfather is a Cambion... a half-demon. Does this bother you?~
@2110 = ~No. Should it?~
@2111 = ~Yes, it does! If I had known, I would never have allowed one of such evil heritage into my party!~
@2112 = ~Yes, we are like tieflings. We share a demonic heritage, although we do not hail from the Planes. We come from the Hellgate, north of here, in the High Forest.~
@2113 = ~Well, yes. A little bit. I did wonder if this was the case... but I have heard that your people are savage and evil. Is this true?~
@2114 = ~Why should it? I judge people by their actions, Fade. I myself have an unusual heritage, as you know. It would be rather presumptuous of me to judge others in a way I would not want to be judged.~
@2115 = ~Yes, of course it does! I had my suspicions all along... and now they have been confirmed! I should never have allowed you to join up with me.~
@2116 = ~You have heard of us? That's a bit surprising... there aren't many of us around. How did you find out about us?~
@2117 = ~I grew up in the fortress of Candlekeep. They have a huge library... the whole Hellgate Saga is chronicled there. So I know all about your people.~
@2118 = ~Depends what you mean by evil. Yes, they are cruel and savage, and many people would consider them evil, but that's just their way. They honestly don't know any different.~
@2119 = ~Really? You surprise me, <CHARNAME>. Many people get quite... upset when I tell them what I am. They think my heritage makes me a demon too.~
@2120 = ~Well, apart from a bit of temper and a blatant disregard for the concept known as "other people's possessions", you don't seem too demonic to me, Fade.~
@2121 = ~It can happen. Some people have difficulty seeing beyond what you are, and seem incapable of seeing *who* you are. I have had the same problem in the past. It is why I do not judge you now.~
@2122 = ~I can see many advantages to that, Fade. I'm sure if you let people think you're a demon, they would do as you wished. And that can't be a bad thing.~
@2123 = ~I am... most thankful for that, <CHARNAME>. It is good to meet someone who knows what it is like to be judged on their heritage alone... you know how it feels. I'm glad it does not bother you.~
@2124 = ~Your heritage may not bother me, but please don't think this means I have dismissed all my misgivings over you. I will not judge you... yet. I still do not entirely trust you.~
@2125 = ~Good. And I'm glad that you've been honest with me.~
@2126 = ~Well, I'm glad we've got that out of the way. Now we can continue our pursuit of Irenicus.~
@2127 = ~I'm sorry you feel that way, <CHARNAME>. I suppose I should have... expected such a response.~
@2128 = ~But I cannot help it. This is the way I was made. (sigh) I suppose I should gather my things... I will be gone as soon as I can.~
@2129 = ~No, Fade, I didn't mean it like that--I overreacted. It's just a bit of a shock, finding out one of your companions is part demon. Please forgive my hasty words.~
@2130 = ~And so, does that... bother you? Considering all you know about us?~
@2131 = ~An interest? Such interests can be bad for you, <CHARNAME>. The Abyss and its denizens are best left alone. Believe me.~
@2132 = ~I'm not about to take advice from you, Fade. My interest has never brought me to harm.~
@2133 = ~But you seem different. Apart from a bit of temper and a blatant disregard for the concept known as "other people's possessions", you don't seem too demonic to me.~
@2134 = ~I... I've experienced things other Fey'ri have not. It's given me a unique view of the world. I don't consider myself different from my kin, it's just... ~
@2135 = ~You've discovered compassion and empathy. You said you wanted to help me, and you've offered yourself to my cause. That's not the kind of behaviour I'd normally expect from one of your kind.~
@2136 = ~You say that about my people? And then what? Wipe out the drow? Then the orc hordes? The Frost Giants? How long before *you* then become the "evil" one, feared by all? That kind of thinking soon snowballs, <CHARNAME>.~
@2137 = ~So what would you suggest? Live and let live? Let the evildoers prey on the weak and innocent forever more? No, we must take action!~
@2138 = ~I suppose there is some wisdom in those words. How long does it take before the freedom fighters become the oppressors? It's not easy, is it? What would you suggest?~
@2139 = ~(laugh) I know when I'm being teased, <CHARNAME>! But I suppose there's a grain of truth to that. I am not "the norm" amongst my kin. I... I've experienced things other Fey'ri have not. It's left me with a different view of the world. Truthfully, I don't consider myself any better or worse than my kin, it's just that... ~
@2140 = ~(laugh) Thank you for that! And you are absolutely correct! I know who I am, who cares what other people think?~
@2141 = ~Sometimes I worry that I won't be accepted... but whether you meant that or not, I have never heard a truer word spoken in jest.~
@2142 = ~I didn't mean it that way, <CHARNAME>! For me, that's a disadvantage, not an advantage. I don't want people to do as I want because they fear me, I just want to make my own way in life.~
@2143 = ~(She turns away, obviously slightly disturbed by your inference)~
@2144 = ~I suppose I can understand that. We haven't travelled together for long. I suppose I hoped you had overcome your misgivings, but then again... it's early days yet.~
@2145 = ~(She gives you a lingering, almost pleading look before turning away)~
@2146 = ~I see no reason not to be honest with you, especially about this. I could hardly lie to you, anyway... the tail and the red eyes are a bit of a giveaway, wouldn't you say?~
@2147 = ~Besides, what chance do I have of you ever trusting me if I'm not honest with you about something as fundamental as my ancestry? Because I *do* want you to trust me.~
@2148 = ~(She stops tightening the straps on her backpack and looks at you. After a while, she gives you a slightly hurt smile)~
@2149 = ~Fair enough. I forgive you. Just please remember in future: do not judge other lest ye be judged yourself.~
@2150 = ~Not many... but enough to last me this lifetime. The Tan'ari normally come to us for... whatever reason. I don't really like talking about it. Let's just say its name barely does it justice.~
@2151 = ~You haven't come to any harm *yet*. All it takes is for one of the Demon Lords to realise a Bhaalspawn has taken an interest in them, and then... I think the phrase commonly used is "a snowball's chance in Hell". Because that's what you'd have.~
@2152 = ~Not that I'd know... about the snowball in Hell. I haven't been there. But if you do insist on continuing this... interest, well... just be careful.~
@2153 = ~I suppose I never thought about it like that before. Thank you for your concern. I will be careful.~
@2154 = ~You're far too kind to me, <CHARNAME>, but I am far from this picture you've painted of me. I just know I have to help. If this is compassion, well... ~
@2155 = ~(She smiles at you and unexpectedly gives you a quick hug) Thank you.~
@2156 = ~Thank me? For what?~
@2157 = ~I... I can't say. Not yet.~
@2158 = ~I'm just not ready. I know you have misgivings about me being here, but I must also know I can trust you first. I'm sorry.~
@2159 = ~And what do you think people will say when they hear that a child of Bhaal, the Lord of Murder, has gone on a killing spree--even if it is against so-called "evildoers"? Talk sense, <CHARNAME>.~
@2160 = ~I suppose I can see your point. It wouldn't be as easy as all that. So what would you suggest?~
@2161 = ~No, it wouldn't be easy. And if I knew the answer... well, I certainly wouldn't be a lackey of the Shadow Thieves, still!~
@2162 = ~I suppose we just have to go along our own paths, doing things as we see fit. It's all anyone can ask. Come on, all this thinking is giving me a headache.~
@2163 = ~For giving me a chance. You have no idea how much I appreciate that.~
@2164 = ~I certainly hope you will, <CHARNAME>. I've... got used to your company, and I'd hate to have to wake up someday and find you a little heap of ash, or worse.~
@2165 = ~May I speak with you?~
@2166 = ~Yes, of course. What is on your mind?~
@2167 = ~Not right now.~
@2168 = ~Again? You're really beginning to wear on my nerves, you know.~
@2169 = ~I am just intrigued. We have spoken much of your...unusual heritage, and I just wonder how that affected you as you were growing up. Were you reviled or revered, I wonder?~
@2170 = ~Actually, my childhood was very pleasant. I knew nothing of my heritage, and those who did know treated me no differently from the other children. I still had to attend my classes, do my chores... and I had my fair share of clips round the ear for misbehaving, as well!~
@2171 = ~Neither. I didn't actually know anything of my heritage as a child. I only found out about it relatively recently, so it was never an issue.~
@2172 = ~My childhood was nothing special. I hardly think about it, to be honest. I didn't know anything about my heritage--hardly anyone did. Gorion made sure of that.~
@2173 = ~Why the hell are you asking me such inane questions, Fade? If you're bored, go pester someone else.~
@2174 = ~Fair enough. I only wanted to ask you a little about yourself. I thought *that* particular topic might engage you for a while, at least.~
@2175 = ~Fade, there's no need for that. I didn't intend to be rude. What do you want to know?~
@2176 = ~I'm not saying I don't want to talk to you, Fade, just that now possibly isn't the best of times. Surely you can see that--why are you so offended?~
@2177 = ~I see. I see that one as self-important as you obviously has no time for one as lowly as me.~
@2178 = ~Self-important? Me? You dare accuse me of that after prattling on about yourself the last few times I've spoken to you? Come on, Fade, it's obvious there's only one person here you want to talk about--yourself.~
@2179 = ~You've got it.~
@2180 = ~But doesn't that annoy or anger you? You may have lived this idyllic childhood, or your perception of an idyllic childhood... but they lied to you about who you are, about what you are. Do you not think that they watched you from the shadows, waiting for Bhaal's blood to manifest in you? What would they have done then?~
@2181 = ~They would not have tolerated that, I am sure. You would have been led like a lamb to the slaughter, only for acting on impulses that are bred in you. Wouldn't you have preferred to have known?~
@2182 = ~What do you mean by all that? I'm glad they *didn't* tell me... I led a normal life, as any child has the right to. And as for these impulses you're alluding to, they weren't there. Maybe if I had been told about my heritage, they would have been stirred up, and things might have happened. But they weren't. Gorion saved me once--he would have done it again, if necessary, of that I'm sure.~
@2183 = ~Of course I would have preferred to have known. It annoys me that they didn't tell me. If they had told me of my heritage earlier on, I would have had time to learn how to deal with my enemies, rather than being plunged into it as I was. I realise Gorion was only trying to shield me, but... well, he left me when I needed him most.~
@2184 = ~Fade, I'm not sure I like you talking about the people I love in such a way. The people of Candlekeep treated me as one of their own, especially the ones who knew about my heritage. Can you imagine how I would have been treated if it had been common knowledge? I would have been feared--no parent would have allowed their child to go near me, let alone be my friend. It would have been a very lonely existence for me, that's for sure. Being surrounded by friends and loved ones probably prevented any darker impulses from surfacing in the first place.~
@2185 = ~They didn't lie to me, Fade. They just... withheld a bit of information for my own good. Nothing positive would have come from telling me, nor from making my heritage common knowledge--in fact, more damage would probably have been caused that way. When Sarevok found out about me, he killed Gorion and came after me. Luckily I was of an age to defend myself. Imagine what would have happened if I had only been a child.~
@2186 = ~You never knew? Why did they not tell you? One of such a... powerful heritage would surely have been seen as an asset to your community. You could have demanded anything of them, and they would have complied.~
@2187 = ~An asset? Are you joking? I would have been a target, nothing more. There would be no laughter, no friends in my childhood had that been the case. Everyone would have pointed, saying "There goes the child of the Lord of Murder... do not anger <PRO_HIMHER> lest you become one of <PRO_HISHER> victims." Everything from a bad harvest to chicken killings would have been laid at my door. No, I am more than happy that Gorion kept it to himself.~
@2188 = ~Do you think I haven't considered that already? I could have had power. Or I could have been killed in my sleep by fearful villagers. But it's in the past now. I wasn't told, and I am what I am because of this. Would you have preferred it any other way? I wouldn't. Things happen for a reason, be they good or bad.~
@2189 = ~I never thought of it that way before... but you're right. They had no right to hide my heritage from me. Just think what I could be by now.~
@2190 = ~But who was he really to keep something so important from you? Don't you think he could at least have been honest about you about your birth? What did he really think to gain from hiding all this from you, I wonder. There must have been something... ~
@2191 = ~What do you mean? He loved me, as a father loves his child. He had nothing to gain from fostering me--in fact he had more to lose. This would have been doubly true if people knew about my heritage. Thankfully they did not.~
@2192 = ~Fade, why must you see conspiracy in everything? I am not entirely sure I like your implication. Gorion raised me as his own... that is enough for me. As for the decisions he made, well, I seem to have turned out all right. I have no complaints.~
@2193 = ~I have often wondered that myself. Maybe he thought he could control me later, as an adult. I don't know. And I suppose I never will, now that he is dead.~
@2194 = ~Inane? Pester? I do not know why I even wanted to talk to you in the first place!~
@2195 = ~Okay, I'm sorry. I suppose I did overreact there... I shouldn't have said that. It is just that I am intrigued. We have spoken much of your... unusual heritage, and I just wonder how that affected you as you were growing up. Were you reviled or revered, I wonder?~
@2196 = ~I only wanted to ask you something, and yet you do not even have time for a simple question! You talk to complete strangers more than you talk to me!~
@2197 = ~Why are you bothered by this, Fade?~
@2198 = ~Of course I do! That is because complete strangers don't fly off the handle unexpectedly, and they don't expect to be the complete focus of my attention all the time! Fade, I don't know what you were expecting from me, but as you said yourself, you're just here to help. Nothing more.~
@2199 = ~I'm not offended, <CHARNAME>, not as such. I should never have said that. I don't even know why I did. I have a bit of a temper sometimes, and I do say things I don't really mean. I'm sorry.~
@2200 = ~I just wanted to ask you something that has intrigued me for a while. We have spoken much of your... unusual heritage, and I just wonder how that affected you as you were growing up. Were you reviled or revered, I wonder?~
@2201 = ~It's okay, Fade. Actually, my childhood was very pleasant. I knew nothing of my heritage, and those who did know treated me no differently from the other children. I still had to attend my classes, do my chores...and I had my fair share of clips round the ear for misbehaving as well!~
@2202 = ~Well, as long as you're sure you didn't mean it... My childhood was nothing special. I hardly think about it, to be honest. I didn't know anything of my heritage--hardly anyone did. Gorion made sure of that.~
@2203 = ~And you wonder why I didn't want to talk to you in the first place? Why the hell are you asking me such inane questions, Fade? If you're bored, go pester someone else.~
@2204 = ~Well, that's where you're wrong! I was actually going to ask you a question about you!~
@2205 = ~Me? What do you want to know about me?~
@2206 = ~Well, there's a turnup for the books, thief. But I don't feel like sharing information about myself with you, okay? Now just leave me alone.~
@2207 = ~You respected Gorion a lot, didn't you?~
@2208 = ~It was more than respect, Fade. He was my father. Maybe not by blood, but I loved him as much as any child can love their father. It still hurts that he is not here to guide me. There are times when I wish... ~
@2209 = ~Yes, I suppose I did. He taught me much. But there is no point dwelling on the past like this, Fade. Things happen for a reason, be they good or bad.~
@2210 = ~I'm sorry, Fade, but I do not wish to discuss Gorion at the moment. Even after all this time, it still hurts me to do so. As for the other aspects of my childhood, I cannot complain. I look back on my childhood fondly... And what of you? How does a Fey'ri upbringing compare to mine?~
@2211 = ~So you feel bitter towards Gorion, then? For not telling you?~
@2212 = ~No, not bitterness. I just can't stop thinking that perhaps, if he had told me, I could have prepared for what happened. I couldn't defend Gorion. I wanted to, but even then, I just thought myself as plain old <CHARNAME>, nothing special about me. If I had known, if I had had the time to prepare, I could have defended him, and he would still be alive now.~
@2213 = ~Of course I do. If he had told me, I could have protected him. But he didn't, so I couldn't, and he died. He left me when I needed him most.~
@2214 = ~I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sully your loved ones. I just... find it hard to believe that they didn't encourage you. The Fey'ri would have revelled in your heritage. You would have been revered, and your impulses encouraged.~
@2215 = ~Did you ever... do you ever... feel the need to... well, destroy things? Destroy... and kill? Just for the pleasure of it all?~
@2216 = ~I don't think I want to answer that, Fade.~
@2217 = ~Of course not! Why? Have you?~
@2218 = ~Sometimes, when I think someone really deserves it. Take Irenicus for example. I could quite happily kill him. I know that everyone has it in them to want to hurt those who have hurt them in some way, but sometimes the intensity of my feelings... well, it scares me.~
@2219 = ~What are you suggesting, Fade? An orgy of death and bloodshed? I knew you would have it in you. You can take a demon out of the abyss, but you can't take the abyss out of a demon, so to speak... ~
@2220 = ~It would have been slaughter. As inexperienced as you were, you were at least an adult when it happened. A child wouldn't have stood a chance. Yes, I understand that, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry to have brought all this up.~
@2221 = ~No need to apologise, Fade. You have every right to be curious... as do I. What about your upbringing? How does a Fey'ri upbringing compare to mine?~
@2222 = ~It's okay. It happened, and nothing can change that. I don't blame you for being curious. So what of you then? What of your childhood?~
@2223 = ~Yes, well, you've certainly managed to stir up a lot of unwanted feelings today. Maybe you should leave me alone for a bit.~
@2224 = ~I suppose you are correct. I must admit, it is not the way I would have seen it.~
@2225 = ~You would have been told of your heritage from the start, if you were Fey'ri. One of such blood would have definitely been seen as an asset, although that would not have protected you from an assassin's blade. It must have been hard for Gorion to keep such a huge secret from you.~
@2226 = ~I don't know how hard it was for him. Obviously we never discussed it. I found out after his death, via a letter he wrote to me. I miss him, you know. When I was a child, I used to wish he wasn't there, so I could play all the time and never have lessons or chores again. I realise now just how much he cared for me. I never got to tell him that.~
@2227 = ~Yes, I hate to think how much he worried about me, whether he wondered if I would just snap one day. But still, through all that, he continued to be my father.~
@2228 = ~I agree. Still, he could have told me. Maybe not as a small child, but as I got older. Then maybe there would have been something I could have done, rather than him just... leaving me like this.~
@2229 = ~(sigh) I wish I could have the courage of your convictions, but I for one cannot hand over the reins of my life to Fate.~
@2230 = ~Well, what of you? I've told you about my childhood--what about yours?~
@2231 = ~I see. Well, we all have to live our lives our own way, I suppose. I just hope that one day you find that courage.~
@2232 = ~You could have been many things, I suppose. Dead is one of them. If you were Fey'ri... well, they would have revelled in your heritage--you would have been revered, and your impulses encouraged.~
@2233 = ~Bothered? I'm not bothered. I just wanted to ask you a little about yourself... to satiate my own curiosity, if you will.~
@2234 = ~We have spoken much of your... unusual heritage, and I just wonder how that affected you as you were growing up. Were you reviled or revered?~
@2235 = ~Fine. Then we have nothing to talk about.~
@2236 = ~Ahhh, so we're interested now, are we? I just wanted to ask you about your childhood, that's all. How you coped with being one of the Children. But if you don't want to... ~
@2237 = ~Okay, Fade, I apologise for being short with you. Actually, my childhood was very pleasant. I knew nothing of my heritage, and those who did know treated me no differently from the other children. I still had to attend my classes, do my chores... and I had my fair share of clips round the ear for misbehaving as well!~
@2238 = ~Fair enough, I think you've made your point. I'm sorry. But my childhood? It was nothing special. I hardly think about it, to be honest. I didn't know anything of my heritage; hardly anyone did. Gorion made sure of that.~
@2239 = ~After all that, you just want to ask me inane questions?! If you're bored, go pester someone else.~
@2240 = ~Since you put it that way... gladly!~
@2241 = ~You wish... what?~
@2242 = ~I wish... it had been me instead of him. I am the direct cause of his death. I try not to dwell on it too much, but... well, you know. I just wish there was something more I could have done.~
@2243 = ~Nothing. I'm sorry, Fade, but I do not wish to discuss Gorion at the moment. Even after all this time, it still hurts me to do so. As for the other aspects of my childhood, I cannot complain. I look back on my childhood fondly... And what of you? How does a Fey'ri upbringing compare to mine?~
@2244 = ~I... my upbringing would have been very different from yours, <CHARNAME>. Very different indeed.~
@2245 = ~(She takes a deep breath, and then looks around, as if she is trying to avoid your gaze. When she realises that you are not about to leave it there, she shakes her head and smiles)~
@2246 = ~Please, let us leave it there. I know it may seem unfair after all I have asked you, but even with Gorion's death, you had a pleasant childhood. I didn't. I just hope you understand that.~
@2247 = ~I understand. I'm sorry.~
@2248 = ~I can sympathise with that, believe me. One day... well, one day I'll tell you all about it. My upbringing was... very different from yours. I just... can't tell you now.~
@2249 = ~He didn't abandon you, <CHARNAME>, and you didn't abandon him. As much as I hate to admit this... sometimes, these things happen. And there's nothing you can do about it.~
@2250 = ~I wish there was, but there isn't. You shouldn't feel bitter--you should feel proud that he was willing to lay his life down for you.~
@2251 = ~That's cold comfort, Fade. But as you said, these things happen. Come on. We've got things to do.~
@2252 = ~I suppose you're right... but you speak as if from experience. Did something similar happen to you? What of your upbringing?~
@2253 = ~One minute you think he was wrong for not telling me, and the next you are defending him? Make up your mind already!~
@2254 = ~I can understand that, <CHARNAME>. However, if you ever do have these feelings, you can always talk to me. One day... well, one day I'll tell you all about it. My upbringing was... very different from yours. I just... can't tell you now.~
@2255 = ~Sometimes. My upbringing was very different from yours, <CHARNAME>. The Fey'ri have a different set of values. One day... well, one day I'll tell you all about it. I just... can't tell you now. I know this may seem a little unfair after everything you have told me, but please, try to understand.~
@2256 = ~There's nothing to be scared of. Your feelings towards Irenicus are natural, I'm sure. He has hurt you a great deal, and we shall make him pay.~
@2257 = ~If I am honest, and I want to be honest with you, I sometimes feel the same way. But then my upbringing was very different from yours. One day... well, one day I'll tell you all about it.~
@2258 = ~And just what do you mean by that? I... I don't want to go there again, be that again... ~
@2259 = ~I... don't want to talk about this with you anymore, <CHARNAME>. Please, excuse me.~
@2260 = ~I was only trying to see things from all perspectives, <CHARNAME>, nothing more. I can see that you were hurt deeply by what has happened, and I'm sorry for bringing it up.~
@2261 = ~No need to apologise, Fade. I shouldn't have blown up like that. You have every right to be curious... as do I. What about your upbringing? How does a Fey'ri upbringing compare to mine?~
@2262 = ~It's okay. I shouldn't have flown off the handle like that. I don't blame you for being curious. So, what of you then? What of your childhood?~
@2263 = ~Yes, I have. I'll make sure you're no longer troubled by my prattling, oh-so-gracious <PRO_LADYLORD> of Murder.~
@2264 = ~Perhaps, <CHARNAME>. We'll see.~
@2265 = ~Yes, we should get moving.~
@2266 = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot help but feel that I brushed you off rather quickly the last time we spoke. It is only natural for you to want to know about my upbringing, especially since I asked you about yours.~
@2267 = ~(smile) So, what do you want to know?~
@2268 = ~Actually, Fade, my interest on that subject has waned. I really couldn't care less whether you told me or not.~
@2269 = ~Well... everything, really. I can't even imagine what the childhood of a part-demon would be like.~
@2270 = ~Oh. Really. Fair enough, then. The truth would probably be too much for your tiny mind anyway.~
@2271 = ~(She turns away, and flicks her tail rather insolently at you)~
@2272 = ~Well, truth be known, I did not have a "childhood" as you would understand it. There were no toys, no games... only competition, violence and chaos. Fey'ri children are encouraged to revel in their basest of instincts in preparation for adulthood. There is so much inter-sibling rivalry that many do not reach maturity.~
@2273 = ~That sounds horrible!~
@2274 = ~What about you, though? Do you have any siblings?~
@2275 = ~Sounds a bit like drow society to me.~
@2276 = ~Only if you know differently. Only now do I realise the extent of the brutality my kin are capable of. Killing for advancement within your family hierarchy is accepted. Killing for the sheer pleasure of it... well, that is almost applauded.~
@2277 = ~So what of your family? Do you have any siblings?~
@2278 = ~That kind of reminds me of the tales told of drow society.~
@2279 = ~I'm truly sorry you had to go through that, Fade.~
@2280 = ~I have some. I had many. Many of us have different fathers. My eldest brother was my mother's pride and joy--he is a cambion, a half-demon, and very powerful. Luckily, being nearly 200 years younger than him, I was barely a threat to him. He left us to join the Blood Wars when I was no more than a babe.~
@2281 = ~As far as I know, I have one full blood brother, two living half-sisters and three living half-brothers, including Freth. There were more.~
@2282 = ~More? You mean they killed each other?~
@2283 = ~So you have one full brother? Tell me about him.~
@2284 = ~That many siblings? I didn't realise the Fey'ri were so fecund.~
@2285 = ~You wouldn't be the first to make that comparison. However, Fey'ri society is far more chaotic than even the drow.~
@2286 = ~Even there, if you are caught in the act of murder, you have to stand a judgement of sorts. Among the Fey'ri, however... one of my half-brothers was caught during the brutal murder of one of my half-sisters. Nothing was done... he had simply eliminated his rival. Such is the way of demons... and of their elven by-blows.~
@2287 = ~That is dreadful. I'm so sorry, Fade. Please, tell me of your siblings.~
@2288 = ~It's a wonder you're not insane! How did you come through all of this?~
@2289 = ~Sorry? Why should you be sorry? None of us knew any differently. You see, the Fey'ri are as brutal to each other as they are to outsiders. One of my half-brothers was actually caught during the brutal murder of one of my half-sisters... he had simply eliminated his rival. Such is the way of demons... and of their elven by-blows.~
@2290 = ~Yes. The Fey'ri see everything as a matter of gain. If you stand in the way of what they want, you are a rival who must therefore be eliminated. Whether you are family or not does not come into it. The only time we stand as one is when the whole house is threatened... and even then, it is a tenuous thing.~
@2291 = ~I can see why you didn't want to discuss this with me at first. Hearing of my happy childhood must have been a wrench for you.~
@2292 = ~Didn't you fear for your life then?~
@2293 = ~So what about your blood-brother? Tell me of him.~
@2294 = ~So... did you kill any of your siblings? Considering how it seems the norm amongst your people... ~
@2295 = ~Xek'ral is my womb-brother... my twin. (sigh) We hated one another... always vying for my mother's attention. Not that she had much use for either of us.~
@2296 = ~He left us to train as a soldier--I do not know whether he is now a member of the Dlardrageth house guard or serving in the Blood Wars. I know it sounds awful, but I couldn't care less.~
@2297 = ~I suppose you couldn't wait to get away from it all.~
@2298 = ~That's awful. Didn't you fear for your life?~
@2299 = ~Oh yes they are. They have to be to sustain our numbers. With literally half the family being slaughtered by the other half, I'm surprised we end up with any siblings left at all. Although, on that logic, I would now be dead... ~
@2300 = ~But you aren't. Didn't you ever fear for your life?~
@2301 = ~Did you ever... kill any of your siblings? Considering it's the done thing... ~
@2302 = ~Like I have said, at the time I knew no different. It's what I went through afterwards that made me realise everything at the Hellgate is so wrong... But that's another tale for another time.~
@2303 = ~Is there anything else you want to know, or have I thoroughly disgusted you enough?~
@2304 = ~You don't disgust me, Fade. I'm sorry these things happened to you, that you had to go through that, but you're here now. Please try not to dwell on it. You have nothing to be ashamed of. Come on, let's talk of other, happier things. Do you know any good riddles?~
@2305 = ~No. Please... continue. What happened to you to make you realise things were so wrong with your people?~
@2306 = ~Well, I would like to say "not really"... but yes, it is. I hear of you and Imoen... of your escapades, of how much your father loved you... I can't even imagine how it would feel to have a loving parent. All we were ever taught was to fight, and win--whatever the cost.~
@2307 = ~Whatever the cost? Did you ever... kill any of your siblings then?~
@2308 = ~Did you ever fear for your life then?~
@2309 = ~Not really. We were prepared to expect assassination attempts from an early age, but as a younger daughter, my only real role in life would have been that of a breeder or soldier anyway.~
@2310 = ~A... breeder? You would have been expected to breed with demons then?~
@2311 = ~Yes. One of my older half-sisters. I thought she was favoured. At the time I felt so proud, so... *justified* when I sank my knife into her throat, and sliced the wings from her back. Normally it is younger siblings being murdered by their older counterpart. For a younger daughter to kill her elder was seen as something to be proud of.~
@2312 = ~That's monstrous, Fade! How could you do such a thing? I... I really cannot believe you murdered your own sister... ~
@2313 = ~Thank you again, <CHARNAME>, for not judging me. Please forgive me, but I am not in the mood for riddles at the moment. I have not had cause to think about my family in some time. I... I think I need some time to myself for a bit.~
@2314 = ~I... I cannot. Again I must ask you to be patient with me. I am sorry. I... I think I need some time to myself for a bit.~
@2315 = ~Yes. The Fey'ri consider those with more demon blood in them stronger. Therefore if your mate is a cambion, or even better, a true Tan'ari, the blood of your offspring is stronger, and that can only benefit your house.~
@2316 = ~Please... let us speak of other things now. I really don't want to think about it.~
@2317 = ~I am a monster. I know.~
@2318 = ~No, that's not what I meant. What you did was monstrous... but like you said yourself, you knew no different. I'm really sorry I brought this up. I was only curious, Fade. I didn't mean to upset you.~
@2319 = ~I... I don't know what to think, Fade. Do you regret what you did?~
@2320 = ~It's not your fault. I haven't thought of my sister in years. I... I think I need some time to myself for a bit.~
@2321 = ~I... I don't know. She was a murdering bitch in her own right. I suppose I regret *why* I did it. It wasn't for any other reason than for gain on my part.~
@2322 = ~I haven't thought of my sister in years. I... I think I need some time to myself for a bit.~
@2323 = ~(Fade walks up beside you and smiles, holding out her hands to you) You will notice that there is nothing in my hands, nor concealed upon my arms.~
@2324 = ~Eh? What are you talking about?~
@2325 = ~(sigh) Fade, don't be tiresome. What are you doing?~
@2326 = ~Going to perform a trick of some kind, then? These are always amusing.~
@2327 = ~(grin) Oh, come on, <CHARNAME>. Just play along, if only for a moment.~
@2328 = ~(She holds her hands out again to you. They are small and deceptively delicate, the fingernails sharp and slightly curved, no doubt another feature of her Tan'ari heritage) Nothing in my hands, right? And nothing concealed up my sleeves.~
@2329 = ~Okay... no, there's nothing in your hands, and I can't see anything being concealed in your sleeves.~
@2330 = ~Fade, I'm not in the mood for silly tricks. Go and show someone who will appreciate it more.~
@2331 = ~Well, I *was* going to show you a trick, but now if you're going to be mean, I'm not going to.~
@2332 = ~Go on then, show me your trick.~
@2333 = ~(laugh) It isn't supposed to be amusing, it's supposed to be astounding!~
@2334 = ~(Fade winks at you and within a blink of an eye snaps her fingers and seems to produce a small flower from thin air. The normal build up of energy that surrounds a magical casting is absent--you know that this was simply a sleight of hand trick)~
@2335 = ~(She holds the flower up for you to look at--it is perfect. You have no idea how she concealed it so well without crushing it)~
@2336 = ~(take the flower from her and examine it) How did you do that? It's not even bruised.~
@2337 = ~(applaud her) Well done!~
@2338 = ~Hmph. Simple sleight of hand--seen it a thousand times before.~
@2339 = ~(sniff) Fine. I'll do that then.~
@2340 = ~(She grins broadly and taps the side of her nose) A trickster *never* reveals her secrets to a layperson! Do you want to see another one?~
@2341 = ~Yes please!~
@2342 = ~No, this one is quite enough. I have to ask though--why the flower? Why not a coin?~
@2343 = ~(She bows low to you and, grinning rather impishly at you, tucks the flower behind your ear) Do you want to see another one?~
@2344 = ~Oh. I thought it might amuse you. Oh well.~
@2345 = ~Okay then.~
@2346 = ~(She turns away from you, obviously preparing her next trick. After a short moment she turns back to you) This time, notice this gold coin.~
@2347 = ~(She holds it up for your inspection, and then throws her hands up in the air. As she snaps her fingers, the gold coin disappears. With a grin, she shows you her hands--they are empty)~
@2348 = ~And now to make it reappear... ~
@2349 = ~(She leans forward, takes your earlobe in between her thumb and forefinger, and rubs lightly. From this, the gold coin appears again. With a smile, she draws it out and holds it in front of your face for your inspection. She then raises an eyebrow and gives you a rather pointed look) Perfect in every way... wouldn't you agree, <CHARNAME>?~
@2350 = ~Are you talking about the gold or my ear?~
@2351 = ~Yes... now hand me back my coin!~
@2352 = ~I... err... Well, it was the easiest thing to hand, I just saw it there and thought... you know. You can... keep it, if you like.~
@2353 = ~(Her cheeks colour slightly, and she hurries back to scouting for you)~
@2354 = ~Well... you choose.~
@2355 = ~(chuckle) You don't miss a trick, do you?~
@2356 = ~(She hands you back your coin and makes her way back to scouting for you)~
@2357 = ~Hmph. Some people just don't appreciate a good thing when they're about to see it.~
@2358 = ~Are you all right, <CHARNAME>? You look tired.~
@2359 = ~I *am* tired. I've not been sleeping too well recently.~
@2360 = ~Of course I'm tired. After everything that has happened, it shouldn't come as a surprise.~
@2361 = ~Thank you for noticing. Next time I want the blatantly obvious pointed out to me, I know where to go.~
@2362 = ~Fade, please just leave me alone.~
@2363 = ~I've... noticed. You seem to spend the whole time you're supposed to be asleep tossing and turning, muttering to yourself.~
@2364 = ~Muttering? What do I say?~
@2365 = ~Well, I've got a lot on my mind at the moment. If it disturbs you, you can always sleep elsewhere.~
@2366 = ~You've been watching me sleep?~
@2367 = ~I suppose not. What you've been through would be enough to give me nightmares for a month... although you do seem to spend more time tossing and turning, muttering to yourself, than you do sleeping.~
@2368 = ~I'm only concerned. There is no need to be rude.~
@2369 = ~There is if you keep pestering me with stupid questions.~
@2370 = ~I know. I didn't mean it. I *am* tired, and it's making me a little cranky. I've not been sleeping too well recently.~
@2371 = ~Well... okay. But if you need anything... ~
@2372 = ~I know where to find you.~
@2373 = ~Like what? Being asked stupid questions and having inane conversations? Oh yes, I know exactly where to go if I want that!~
@2374 = ~Unless you have some kind of fantastic remedy for bad dreams and headaches, I doubt whether you'll be able to help me, Fade.~
@2375 = ~Yes. I'll be right here, <CHARNAME>.~
@2376 = ~I don't know. I can never make any of it out. But sometimes it seems like you want something... and other times it seems like you're fending something off.~
@2377 = ~So, I see you've made some kind of habit of watching me sleep?~
@2378 = ~I don't think it would take Elminster to work out what that's all about.~
@2379 = ~I know. It seems like I can't escape my situation even when I'm asleep. But unless you have some kind of fantastic remedy for bad dreams and headaches they seem to cause, I doubt whether you'll be able to help me, Fade.~
@2380 = ~I'm not reprimanding you, <CHARNAME>. I'm just concerned, that's all. This lack of restful sleep must be very draining for you.~
@2381 = ~Yes, it is. But unless you have some kind of fantastic remedy for bad dreams and headaches they seem to cause, I doubt whether you'll be able to help me, Fade.~
@2382 = ~Thank you for pointing that out, Fade. You know, I really wouldn't have been able to guess that on my own. Good thing I have you to point out the blatantly obvious and ask me stupid questions, isn't it?~
@2383 = ~Uh... no. I'm just concerned, that's all. This lack of restful sleep must be very draining for you.~
@2384 = ~I sometimes wonder why I even bother talking to you!~
@2385 = ~I don't know anything that'll stop the bad dreams, but I *might* be able to help with the headache.~
@2386 = ~Really? Go on, then.~
@2387 = ~No, it's all right. I'll be okay.~
@2388 = ~No, neither do I. You're struggling with yourself, <CHARNAME>... your impulses and your instincts. I wish I could help you.~
@2389 = ~I know. I kind of figured that out for myself. Now, do you have any more stupid questions, or do I have to suffer more inane conversation?~
@2390 = ~I know. And I wish you could help me. It kind of worries me a bit. What if I end up giving in?~
@2391 = ~I guess. Although there's nothing you can do about it, unless you have some kind of fantastic remedy for bad dreams and headaches they seem to cause.~
@2392 = ~(She nods, places her fingertips at specific places on your scalp and neck, and with a small smile begins a light massage. At first you feel nothing, but then eventually you do feel some of the tension in your neck leave, and the pain behind your eyes lessens.)~
@2393 = ~Does that feel better? I can't do it properly while we're walking along, but it may help.~
@2394 = ~That feels much better, thanks. Where did you learn to do that?~
@2395 = ~Yes, that does feel better. Thanks.~
@2396 = ~Well, as long as you're sure.~
@2397 = ~You won't. You're the strongest person I've ever met, <CHARNAME>, and if you think you are losing it... well, your friends will be here to help you.~
@2398 = ~Oh, I've... picked things up, here and there... ~
@2399 = ~(She smiles, but there is an uncertain edge to it) If you get any more headaches, just tell me.~
@2400 = ~It's a pleasure. If you get any more headaches, just tell me.~
@2401 = ~(As you settle down to rest, Fade removes her cloak and you realise that marring one of her shoulders is what seems to be a nasty burn)~
@2402 = ~Ouch, Fade. Where did you get that burn?~
@2403 = ~How did you get that... mark, Fade? If you don't mind me asking.~
@2404 = ~(As soon as she realises you have noticed the strange mark, she contrives to cover it up, looking slightly worried) Burn? It's not a burn.~
@2405 = ~Looks like a burn to me. What is it, then?~
@2406 = ~No? So... what is it? If you don't mind me asking.~
@2407 = ~(She gives you a measured look, but then sighs and shrugs) It's a... brand.~
@2408 = ~A brand? Like on cattle? How did you get one of those?~
@2409 = ~A brand? I... see. How long were you a slave, then?~
@2410 = ~Why would someone want to brand you? Did you do something wrong?~
@2411 = ~(sigh) No, I don't mind. I suppose you have... the right to know.~
@2412 = ~It's okay. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.~
@2413 = ~Of course I have the right to know. If there's something going on, I need to know how it might affect all of us.~
@2414 = ~I have the right to know what, Fade?~
@2415 = ~(She turns on you, her eyes flashing angrily) Cattle? Cattle?? I was a slave, okay? A slave! (she whirls round and storms off)~
@2416 = ~(catch her by the arm) A slave? When? Where? How?~
@2417 = ~(go after her and catch her lightly by the arm) Fade! I didn't realise! I really didn't realise... ~
@2418 = ~A slave? You? You're kidding... right?~
@2419 = ~(She looks at her feet, and starts to draw a pattern in the dust with a toe) About five years, at a guess. You can't really keep track of time much. I was sold to a Pasha in Calimshan.~
@2420 = ~That's awful! But at least you are safe now... aren't you?~
@2421 = ~Five years? What kind of slave were you?~
@2422 = ~Five years? How did you escape?~
@2423 = ~So what have you been doing ever since? Just running around Athkatla?~
@2424 = ~And if I did? As it happens, I was a slave, okay?~
@2425 = ~A slave? I... see. How did it happen? How did you escape?~
@2426 = ~A slave? When? Where? How?~
@2427 = ~A slave? I... see. What kind of slave were you?~
@2428 = ~So, does this mean your... owners... will be after you?~
@2429 = ~(She turns to you, sighs and sits down heavily, hugging her knees) I know. It's not the kind of thing that one shouts about. I was captured and sold to a Pasha in Calimshan.~
@2430 = ~I... see. How did it happen? How did you escape?~
@2431 = ~I... see. What kind of slave were you?~
@2432 = ~A slave? Does this mean your... owners... will be after you?~
@2433 = ~I wish I was, <CHARNAME>. But unfortunately, that is not the case. I was captured and sold to a Pasha in Calimshan.~
@2434 = ~So, what about your previous... owners? Does this mean they will be after you?~
@2435 = ~How did I escape? It's not important, really. The fact that I did is all you need to worry about at the moment, <CHARNAME>.~
@2436 = ~I... will tell you, but just not now. I hope you understand.~
@2437 = ~Of course I understand, Fade. Tell me when you are ready. Can I ask one other thing, though?~
@2438 = ~I'll decide what I worry about, Fade. I can't believe you've kept this from me, and are now withholding more. For all I know, you might still have people after you. I want the details, and I want them now.~
@2439 = ~Why does everyone do this to me? They start to tell me something, and then when I ask for details... I'm fed up of it! So you can keep your little secret for all I care--I'm not interested!~
@2440 = ~(As soon as she realises you have noticed the strange mark, she contrives to cover it up, looking slightly worried, but then sighs and shrugs) No, I don't mind. I suppose you have the... right to know.~
@2441 = ~(She shakes her head) You'll probably find out anyway, and I'd rather tell you myself. It's a brand. I... I was a slave, <CHARNAME>.~
@2442 = ~(A flash of anger crosses her eyes) It's a brand, okay? I got it when I was bought. Nothing that will affect you in any way.~
@2443 = ~Bought? What do you mean, bought? Were you a slave or something?~
@2444 = ~Bought... ? Oh, I understand. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... ~
@2445 = ~Bought? What were you, a slave or something? I wouldn't have thought you would have put up with that.~
@2446 = ~Bought? Hmmm... so that's your deal with slavery then.~
@2447 = ~(sigh) You have the right to... to know about my past. This... this is a brand. I got it when... when I was a slave.~
@2448 = ~How did it happen? It's not important, really. And the fact that I escaped is all you need to worry about at the moment, <CHARNAME>.~
@2449 = ~(She manages a wry smile) Is it that much of a surprise to you? It happened years ago. I was... captured, and sold to a Pasha in Calimshan.~
@2450 = ~Calimshan? What kind of slave were you there?~
@2451 = ~You were captured? How did that happen? And how did you escape?~
@2452 = ~I was bought as an exotic oddity. For years I fought in the gladiator pits, and worked in the harem.~
@2453 = ~(She gives you a look that is both acutely fragile and fiercely proud) Does this bother you?~
@2454 = ~Well, the gladiator pit bit doesn't, but the harem... ?~
@2455 = ~Well, I know that many slaves have to work the harem, but killing people as a spectacle... ?~
@2456 = ~No, it doesn't bother me. You did what you had to. I'm just grateful you're here now.~
@2457 = ~Yes, it does! So you were a whore and a murderer... How can you live with yourself?~
@2458 = ~I don't know. It's been quite some time now, and if they are after me, I've never heard anything. I... do keep a low profile, just in case. You... you don't think they would still... after all this time... ~
@2459 = ~No, that's insane. It's been so long... they probably think I'm dead or something.~
@2460 = ~I don't know, Fade. I mean, they must have paid good money for you. If it was me, I'd want to get you back.~
@2461 = ~You're probably right. There's no way they would still be after you after all this time. What were you to them, anyway?~
@2462 = ~I'm sorry, Fade, but I really don't want to have to find out you're wrong. You're handy in a fight and all, but I can't risk having you in the party. I must ask you to leave.~
@2463 = ~I was a slave. Bought in Calimshan, by a Pasha. For years I fought in the gladiator pits, and worked in the harem.~
@2464 = ~It's all right, <CHARNAME>. It happened years ago. I was... captured, and sold to a Pasha in Calimshan.~
@2465 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, I was a slave. Bought in Calimshan, by a Pasha. For years I fought in the gladiator pits, and worked in the harem. And it wasn't like I had any choice.~
@2466 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, that's my "deal" with slavery. I was bought in Calimshan, by a Pasha. For years I fought in the gladiator pits, and worked in the harem. And it wasn't like I had any choice.~
@2467 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>.~
@2468 = ~What kind of slave were you?~
@2469 = ~What have you been doing since you escaped? Just running around Athkatla?~
@2470 = ~What about your... former owners? Won't they be looking for you?~
@2471 = ~Well you're not going to get them! I'm... not ready to tell you. Sorry. Good night.~
@2472 = ~I don't know. I hope so. It's been quite some time now, and if they are after me, I've never heard anything. I... do keep a low profile, just in case. You... you don't think they would still... after all this time... ~
@2473 = ~Surviving. In any way possible.~
@2474 = ~But then I met you. Life has definitely taken a... turn for the better. (sigh) Let's not talk of such things anymore. Let us eat, and rest, and... oh, I don't know, tell silly stories or something.~
@2475 = ~I know. I have to live with the fact that I was... that I was... a whore. I had no choice. It didn't matter if I protested. Some of them... preferred it that way, anyway. I... really don't want to talk about it.~
@2476 = ~I can... understand that, Fade. So what have you been doing since? Just running around Athkatla?~
@2477 = ~I... had no idea. If you ever do need anyone to talk to... ~
@2478 = ~Oh, Fade... .(give her a hug)~
@2479 = ~Just how many men have you had to... entertain, Fade?~
@2480 = ~I know. I have to live with the fact that I was... that I was... a murderer. I had no choice. It was either kill, or be killed. Sometimes with weapons, sometimes with my bare hands. I really don't want to talk about it.~
@2481 = ~Just how many people have you killed, Fade?~
@2482 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. It means a lot to hear you say that. Life has definitely taken a... turn for the better since I met you. (sigh) Let's not talk of such things anymore. Let us eat, and rest, and... oh, I don't know, tell silly stories or something.~
@2483 = ~I live to the best of my capabilities! It's not like I had a choice, you know. I take it you've never been tortured for hours on end, or flogged until your back bleeds? Or been held down by two men, while another... ~
@2484 = ~I'm not prepared to discuss this with you at the moment, <CHARNAME>. And I need... a little time to myself.~
@2485 = ~"If you were them?" But you're right. It worries me, too. I just hope I was so insignificant that... I just don't matter to them anymore. But maybe that's just wishful thinking.~
@2486 = ~I'm sorry, Fade. You're handy in a fight and all... but with all of this... I can't risk having you in the party. I must ask you to leave.~
@2487 = ~Well, at least I know now, and can prepare, just in case the worst does happen. But I need some rest now, and so do you. We can discuss this further later.~
@2488 = ~Enough. I don't see why it should bother you. It doesn't... directly affect you.~
@2489 = ~I... I need to rest, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry. We can discuss this another day.~
@2490 = ~I... I see, <CHARNAME>. I won't trouble you any longer with my presence, then.~
@2491 = ~(She gives you a final hurt, confused look, and melts away into the shadows)~
@2492 = ~(smile) I know who to go to. I know. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. (sigh) Let's not talk of such things anymore. Let us eat, and rest, and... oh, I don't know, tell silly stories or something.~
@2493 = ~(At first she almost tries to fight your embrace, but then as she relaxes, she returns it, burying her face into your shoulder. You cannot help but notice the almost spicy scent of her hair, and the way she curls her fingers around the back of your neck. After a while, and almost reluctantly it seems, she breaks away from you)~
@2494 = ~Thank you. I... I needed that. (smile) But let us not talk of such things anymore. Let's eat, and rest, and... oh, I don't know, tell silly stories or something.~
@2495 = ~Fine, <CHARNAME>! I'll just keep to myself from now on!~
@2496 = ~Yes... later. Sleep well then, <CHARNAME>.~
@2497 = ~(As you walk along, you turn to regard Fade. Now you know why she wanted to help you recover Imoen, but you still wonder exactly how she became a Shadow Thief in the first place. She notices your thoughtful gaze and smiles at you) Are you okay, <CHARNAME>? Do you want to ask me something?~
@2498 = ~No, no. It's okay.~
@2499 = ~Well, there is one thing, actually. Now you've told me about your... past, I just wondered how you became a Shadow Thief.~
@2500 = ~It's nothing really. I suppose I am just wondering what ever possessed you to join the Shadow Thieves, that's all.~
@2501 = ~Are you entirely sure? You know you can ask me anything.~
@2502 = ~Anything? Ummm... okay. What's the capital of Sembia?~
@2503 = ~Well, I don't want to pry, but I did just wonder how you became a Shadow Thief.~
@2504 = ~I just wondered what ever possessed you to join the Shadow thieves. Like I said, it's nothing *that* important.~
@2505 = ~Well, I can't tell you the details. We *are* a kind of secret organization... ~
@2506 = ~Secret? Hardly! Everyone knows who the Shadow Thieves are.~
@2507 = ~No, you misunderstand me. I'm not interested in how other people become Shadow Thieves--I want to know how *you* became one. Whatever possessed you to join?~
@2508 = ~Nothing "possessed" me. I was just... offered membership.~
@2509 = ~So they just took one look at you and said, "Hey, stranger! Would you like to join our club", then?~
@2510 = ~I see. I take it that the... offer was too good to refuse, then?~
@2511 = ~You were just offered membership? Why on earth did you say yes?~
@2512 = ~<CHARNAME>, I was being serious! What do you want to know?~
@2513 = ~Yes, everyone knows of us. But what do we *actually* get up to? Who are our members? Can you actually name any other Shadow Master, apart from Aran? I bet you didn't even know who Aran Linvail was until Gaelan told you.~
@2514 = ~(chuckle) Okay, you win. You're right. The Shadow Thieves are either the worst kept or the best kept secret in the world. Everyone knows they exist, but no one knows much about them.~
@2515 = ~(laugh) True! You seem to know Aran quite well, though. What's he like?~
@2516 = ~Hmph. You act as if that's something to be proud of.~
@2517 = ~(chuckle) Of course not! It is... quite hard to become a full member of the Shadow Thieves. (sigh) You know I lived on the streets for a while? Well, I got caught thieving on Renal Bloodscalp's patch. He was NOT impressed with what I was doing... but he was impressed by how I was doing it. It seemed like even on my own, I was cutting into their profits.~
@2518 = ~They locked me up for a while, but just as I thought I was going to remain locked up for good, another man came to see me. And, to my surprise, he offered me a position. It was nothing fancy--just permission to carry on with what I was already doing, as long as I gave everything to the Guild. In return, I would be fed, clothed, paid and have a place to call home.~
@2519 = ~For someone scratching a living on the streets... well, it sounded a good deal.~
@2520 = ~You don't sound so convinced now.~
@2521 = ~So they locked you up and gave you an ultimatum, then?~
@2522 = ~(shrug) Kind of. You know I lived on the streets for a while? Well, I got caught thieving on Renal Bloodscalp's patch. He was NOT impressed with what I was doing... but he was impressed by how I was doing it. It seemed like even on my own, I was cutting into their profits.~
@2523 = ~They caught me thieving on their patch. I didn't have much of a choice, really. They were NOT impressed by what I was doing, but they were impressed by how I was doing it... It seemed like even on my own, I was cutting into their profits.~
@2524 = ~(grin) Exactly.~
@2525 = ~So why did you join, then? Was the offer to good to refuse?~
@2526 = ~My Shadow Master? He is... fair. Please excuse me, but I do not really have the authority to speak about him.~
@2527 = ~What do you mean, "authority"? I only asked what he was like.~
@2528 = ~I see. So why did you join them then? Was the offer too good to refuse?~
@2529 = ~What do you mean by that? The Shadow Thieves do much for Athkatla... ~
@2530 = ~Exactly *how* do the Shadow Thieves contribute to Athkatla? Apart from keeping the crime rate up and the City Guard in jobs?~
@2531 = ~Of course, Fade. Exactly how did you join them then?~
@2532 = ~I don't know what you're talking about, <CHARNAME>.~
@2533 = ~I think you do, Fade. How different is your service to Aran from your previous stint as a slave? I get the distinct impression Aran really didn't leave you much choice... it was either join up or rot in a cage.~
@2534 = ~Oh, come on, Fade, they gave you an ultimatum! Either join up with us or stay locked up forever.~
@2535 = ~No! It wasn't like that... it wasn't. I... No... ~
@2536 = ~Who are you trying to convince, Fade? Me... or yourself? Just think about it. Aran didn't really give you much of a choice to say no, did he?~
@2537 = ~You do not make... you cannot... I'm not... I--I can't make judgments on my Shadow Master! Like I said, he is fair. He is good to me. I like him. That's enough.~
@2538 = ~Ahhh, I see. He's "good to you", is he? So *that's* what this is all about.~
@2539 = ~Okay, Fade, okay. I won't push you. Tell me then of how you joined the Shadow Thieves. Was it too good an offer to turn down?~
@2540 = ~That is not funny. Aran has taken many a young destitute away from... a hard life. Many youngsters join us, unable to read or write. We teach them, you know? We encourage them to better themselves.~
@2541 = ~Hmmm... I take it by "we", you actually mean Aran. You seem to know him quite well. What is he really like?~
@2542 = ~Through the profession of thievery? Don't make me laugh! You're as much of a slave to the Shadow Thieves as you were to the Pasha!~
@2543 = ~It wasn't like that! It... isn't like that! I... I don't want to talk to you anymore, <CHARNAME>. I think I need to calm down elsewhere.~
@2544 = ~(She turns away, her tail lashing, with a look of anger... and something else... in her eyes)~
@2545 = ~(She narrows her eyes at you, obviously not amused) No, it isn't. It's not like that. I was caught thieving on his patch. I was locked up. He was impressed by my thieving skills, so he offered me a job. Simple as that.~
@2546 = ~Simple as that? So he locked you up and said "join us or I'll throw away the key"? That's not much of a choice, Fade.~
@2547 = ~And exactly how is this different from your previous stint as a slave? Okay, you weren't bought, but you certainly didn't join for your own free will.~
@2548 = ~That's not true! I am my own woman now! It's never... been that way! I... I don't want to talk to you anymore, <CHARNAME>. I think I need to calm down elsewhere.~
@2549 = ~(Fade catches your arm and flashes you an uncertain smile) <CHARNAME>... I feel dreadful for getting annoyed at you the last time we spoke. I... I have no excuse. You asked me a perfectly reasonable question, and... I'm sorry I blew up at you.~
@2550 = ~Well, I was a little surprised, but I guess you have your reasons. I accept your apology.~
@2551 = ~Bugger off, Fade. I've had enough of you blowing hot and cold with me.~
@2552 = ~So why did you get angry with me in the first place?~
@2553 = ~I do have my reasons... and I thank you for forgiving me. You seem to be doing that a lot, you know?~
@2554 = ~It's okay. When people talk like we do, they're bound to disagree at some point, so no hard feelings, okay? But... can I ask why you got angry with me in the first place?~
@2555 = ~I guess I deserved that. Will you at least allow me to explain? I really would hate to leave this unresolved, and I think I really do need to talk to someone about it.~
@2556 = ~Talk about what, exactly? Why you got angry with me?~
@2557 = ~Okay, you've got five minutes. After that... ~
@2558 = ~No, Fade. I mean it. I've had enough. You're more trouble than you're worth.~
@2559 = ~Then... that's it, then? I thought you... we... Don't worry, <CHARNAME>, I'll stop troubling you from now on.~
@2560 = ~(sigh) I got angry with you because... I've been thinking along the same lines myself. The Shadow Thieves gave me a chance to actually belong somewhere... but at what price?~
@2561 = ~Sounds like you've discovered a conscience, Fade.~
@2562 = ~You don't like being a thief, then?~
@2563 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I'm sure you'll understand when I explain it all to you. (sigh) I got angry with you because... I've been thinking along the same lines myself. The Shadow Thieves gave me a chance to actually belong somewhere... but at what price?~
@2564 = ~Well, now I know and I still don't care. Good day.~
@2565 = ~Maybe. Most of what goes on doesn't bother me. It's just business, after all. But some of the Shadow Thieves deal in slaves, <CHARNAME>, smuggling them into Athkatla for the slave auctions. They don't sell them themselves, but they are still part of it all... and I can't be a part of that!~
@2566 = ~I see. And is that all that is troubling you?~
@2567 = ~I can see why you wouldn't like that. Have you petitioned Aran to put a stop to it?~
@2568 = ~So they smuggle people. If it worries you that much, just turn a blind eye.~
@2569 = ~It's not that. Most of what goes on is just business. But I found out that some of the Guild Leaders deal in slaves, smuggling them into Athkatla for the slave auctions. They don't sell them themselves, but they are still part of it all... I can't be part of that!~
@2570 = ~That, and the fact that no matter how much I wanted to leave, I couldn't... ~
@2571 = ~Do you want to leave?~
@2572 = ~Yes you could. Aran has no right to make you do things you don't want to. Do you want to leave?~
@2573 = ~Maybe you should have thought about that before you joined, then.~
@2574 = ~I've mentioned it, but... he may be the Shadow Master here, but most Guilds are autonomous, As long as they pay their dues, how they actually obtain them is up to the individual Guild Leaders. There's nothing I can do.~
@2575 = ~Then maybe you should leave. If you don't agree with what is going on, don't be a part of it. Simple as that.~
@2576 = ~You could always leave. Do you want to leave?~
@2577 = ~How can you be so heartless, <CHARNAME>? There is no way I could just "turn a blind eye" to it. No one deserves to be a slave!~
@2578 = ~Okay, calm down. I suppose I didn't mean it that way. I meant that if you don't like it, don't be a part of it. Just leave. Do you want to leave?~
@2579 = ~Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you joined. The Shadow Thieves *are* a criminal organization, after all.~
@2580 = ~I... I don't know. Sometimes... yes. But then I have some measure of respect there, and I belong. That's all I've ever wanted, <CHARNAME>--to belong somewhere. I don't expect you to understand that, but it makes all the bad things slightly more bearable.~
@2581 = ~I can understand that perfectly, Fade. After years of being an outcast, you want some security. But that security has to be on your own terms, not dictated by somebody else.~
@2582 = ~Fade, don't be so weak! Stand up for yourself. "Belonging" isn't such a big deal. Being yourself and living your own life is!~
@2583 = ~Belonging somewhere is fine, Fade, but not when it clashes so fundamentally with what you believe. You don't agree with slavery, therefore you shouldn't have to deal in it. Just leave! Simple as that.~
@2584 = ~You think I had much of a choice? You were right last time we spoke, it *was* a case of "join us or rot in a cage". I... I don't know what to do. For once, I actually belong somewhere... I'm actually part of something. But them I realize... it's more like being trapped.~
@2585 = ~(sigh) I don't want to unburden on you, <CHARNAME>. I just needed to get it off my chest. I don't expect you to understand that, but it makes all the bad things slightly more bearable.~
@2586 = ~But it's not as simple as that. I know too much. I'm not high up in the Shadow Thief hierarchy by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm still valued. Aran would be losing not only a member, but a source of income too. I don't think he'd appreciate that.~
@2587 = ~And since when was it Aran's decision as to what you do with your life? Fade, if you want to leave, I'll stand by you.~
@2588 = ~Can't you see it, Fade? He's using you in exactly the same way the slavers did. You belong to him... you are just another commodity. You have to leave.~
@2589 = ~Well, it's up to you. I think you know what you have to do, but only you can actually make it happen.~
@2590 = ~I know. I am aware of this. One day... well, one day I may... I can't express it, <CHARNAME>. It's hard for me. I can't betray my Shadow Master like that, but at the same time, I want to live my own life.~
@2591 = ~Well, thank you for listening to my ramblings. It's nice to know that I do have someone I can talk to.~
@2592 = ~I am NOT being weak! I am... I... ~
@2593 = ~(sigh) No, you're right. I *am* being weak. It's just that all I have ever wanted, since my... capture and escape... is to belong somewhere. I don't want to betray my Shadow Master, but at the same time, I want to live my own life.~
@2594 = ~Maybe I should take a leaf out of your book. Thank you for listening to my ramblings. It's nice to know that I do have someone I can talk to.~
@2595 = ~(She pauses, obviously not expecting you to make this offer. After a short while, she gives you a small smile. She then takes your hand and holds it up to her lips, planting a feather-light kiss on your knuckles)~
@2596 = ~I doubt you have any idea what that offer means to me, <CHARNAME>. Thank you. But I can't leave yet. I can't betray my Shadow Master like that, but then again, at the same time, I want to live my own life.~
@2597 = ~So what would you propose I do, then? Just run away--again? I've run away from every problem in my life, <CHARNAME>. I can't do it again. Better to belong, to be part of something and slightly discontented, than to be on your own and lonely.~
@2598 = ~Fade, that's a very weak attitude to take. Stop letting other people dictate what your happiness should be! Stand up for yourself!~
@2599 = ~But you wouldn't be on your own. If you decided to leave, I'd stand by you.~
@2600 = ~I know. But I'm not ready to make any decision like that... not yet. I don't want to betray my Shadow Master, but at the same time, I want to live my own life.~
@2601 = ~(You notice Fade looking quite dreamily off into the distance, smiling slightly to herself)~
@2602 = ~Copper for your thoughts, Fade?~
@2603 = ~Oi! Pay attention back there!~
@2604 = ~(sigh) It's nothing. I was just thinking that one day, I'd like to travel. I see everything around me, and I just want to keep on exploring... ~
@2605 = ~What do you mean? You're an adventurer now! We travel all the time.~
@2606 = ~I know what you mean. There are lots of places on Faerun I want to explore.~
@2607 = ~I don't. I'd be quite happy to just find somewhere I can call home.~
@2608 = ~Oh! Sorry, I sort of drifted off there. I was just thinking that one day, I'd like to travel... ~
@2609 = ~You're not here to daydream, Fade. Please concentrate.~
@2610 = ~That's not what I meant! I know we travel a lot as adventurers, but we're always fighting and doing things like... oh, I don't know, rescuing cats out of trees. I'd like to travel just for the sheer pleasure of visiting new places.~
@2611 = ~So where would you like to go?~
@2612 = ~Hmmm... sounds a bit selfish to me.~
@2613 = ~Ahhh, I see. I guess I agree with you. It would be nice to visit places just for the hell of it, rather than because you have to.~
@2614 = ~(She smiles and loosely links her arm with yours) So where would you like to go most?~
@2615 = ~I don't know. There are lots of places. Tell me where you'd like to go, and see if you can inspire me.~
@2616 = ~I'd like to go to Icewind Dale... I'd love to see the Ten Towns and the mountains. Plus, I like snow!~
@2617 = ~I'd like to go to Silverymoon. They are supposed to have the best library on all Faerun. It's supposed to be a very cultured place.~
@2618 = ~I think I'd like to visit Chult... I've always wanted to visit a jungle.~
@2619 = ~It's Calimshan all the way for me--hot and exotic! That's where I'd like to visit.~
@2620 = ~(smile) I know that feeling too, <CHARNAME>. But wouldn't you like to see the mountains of Icewind Dale, or the jungles of Chult? I would.~
@2621 = ~Nope. Icewind Dale would just be cold, and the jungle would be full of spiders and huge, biting insects. I'd be more than happy just to go back to the Sword Coast and stay there.~
@2622 = ~I suppose... possibly. But I wouldn't like to do it alone.~
@2623 = ~All right, all right. Honestly, give them some divine blood and they think they run everything... ~
@2624 = ~Hmmm... I don't really know. I'd like to go to Chult, to see the jungle... and possibly Icewind Dale, to see the mountains.~
@2625 = ~What I'd like to do most, though, is to go sailing. Not as a working sailor--just to explore the seas. It'd be so free... just me and the wind and the waves... (sigh)~
@2626 = ~Seems like that would be pretty lonely, though. Wouldn't you like company?~
@2627 = ~(hold her hand) Fade, you yearn for freedom so much, don't you? You're like a bird battering itself against the bars of its cage, not realizing that the door is already open.~
@2628 = ~I wouldn't like that. I don't really like the sea.~
@2629 = ~Why is it selfish? I don't mind helping people, but sometimes... well, sometimes it would be nice to go somewhere on your own terms, not because you've been drafted into going there!~
@2630 = ~Well, when you put it like that... I see your point. Where would you like to go?~
@2631 = ~(laugh) You complete child! Snow is nice, though. I'd love to visit the mountains too.~
@2632 = ~(smile) Yes, I've heard Silverymoon is a very beautiful city. I'd prefer to visit slightly wilder places, though.~
@2633 = ~I'd love to go to the jungle too! Even though in reality it would probably be full of snakes and biting insects... but we can dream!~
@2634 = ~I... don't think I'd like to go back to Calimshan, <CHARNAME>.~
@2635 = ~Oh Gods, Fade, I'm sorry! I didn't think. On second thought, I don't think I'd like to go there either... unless it was to kill that bloody Pasha!~
@2636 = ~Fade, you have to face it at some point. You can't hide from Calimshan. What happens if we're sent there for some reason? At least this way, I'd be with you.~
@2637 = ~Well, I'm not asking you to come with me, am I?~
@2638 = ~(laugh) You like your creature comforts, don't you, <CHARNAME>? Well, I can relate to that. I just wouldn't want to do it straight away.~
@2639 = ~Neither would I, <CHARNAME>. Neither would I. Visiting all these places wouldn't be much fun without someone to share the experience with. (she smiles and laces her fingers with yours)~
@2640 = ~I suppose that depends on who it is.~
@2641 = ~Well, how about me?~
@2642 = ~(She looks at your hand holding hers for a while, and then looks up at you. She then leans towards you and gently places a kiss on your cheek) Yes... the door is indeed open. And I have you to thank for that. Maybe after all of this... well, we'll see.~
@2643 = ~(She smiles warmly at you and as you begin to walk together, she does not relinquish your hand)~
@2644 = ~Oh. That's a shame, <CHARNAME>. It would have been nice to... have had some company, if I did ever get to go to sea.~
@2645 = ~Well, you'd have to look for company elsewhere, because I only get on boats if I have to. Sorry.~
@2646 = ~Well, maybe I'd be able to stomach it, just for a little while.~
@2647 = ~Hmmm. In that case, I'll just have to find a way to make you change your mind, don't I? (grin)~
@2648 = ~Y-you'd do that? I mean, you'd go up against the Pasha... for me? Why would you want to do that?~
@2649 = ~Because he's a complete bastard, that's why! There's no way I'd let him live if I came across him, after what he's done to you. I... you're... my friend, Fade.~
@2650 = ~Because he's a monster, Fade. After what he's done to you, and to countless others... I would have to stop him. I couldn't let him live.~
@2651 = ~(She smiles despite herself) You'd go to Calimshan with me, if need be? Then I'm sure to be safe. Not just from the Pasha, but from all the bad memories as well.~
@2652 = ~(grin) I'm sure I could take your mind off any problems... ~
@2653 = ~You can't use me as your security blanket, Fade. I'd go with you, but you'd need to face up to your fears yourself. But not alone, if you get my meaning.~
@2654 = ~(She looks crestfallen for a moment, but quickly composes herself) No, I suppose you're not. It probably would be best if you went alone, anyway.~
@2655 = ~(A warm smile suffuses her face as she takes your hand) You'd be my first choice, <CHARNAME>.~
@2656 = ~(grin) You never know. We might find a nice tropical beach where we could laze in the sun all day eating exotic fruit. I'm sure that would more than make up for any sea-going discomfort!~
@2657 = ~You and your imagination! It would be nice though, wouldn't it? Warm weather, good company... you couldn't ask for any more, could you?~
@2658 = ~Lazing in the sun and eating fruit? Come on, Fade. I'm sure we can think of better ways to spend our time... ~
@2659 = ~Ahhh... it's nice to dream, but I doubt it would ever happen. Oh well.~
@2660 = ~(She looks at you intently and then takes your hand) Thank you, <CHARNAME>. (she then leans towards you and places a feather-light kiss on your cheek)~
@2661 = ~(smile) That's very... honourable of you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you. Too many people have suffered to satisfy him.~
@2662 = ~(She arches an eyebrow at you) I'm sure you could, <CHARNAME>.~
@2663 = ~(She then gives you a decidedly rapacious grin and allows her eyes to travel the length of your body) I'm sure you could.~
@2664 = ~(sigh) Yes, I know what you mean. You're very good to me, and so I mustn't use you as my shield against the world. But just knowing that you would be there... that would give me all the strength I would need.~
@2665 = ~(She flashes you a wicked grin and raises her eyebrows at you) Well... *I* could.~
@2666 = ~(grin) I'm sure we could, <CHARNAME>.~
@2667 = ~(She then gives you a decidedly rapacious grin and allows her eyes to travel the length of your body) I'm sure we could.~
@2668 = ~(sigh) I suppose not. Still, better to dream than to have nothing and all that nonsense, eh?~
@2669 = ~(She takes your hand) Come on, <CHARNAME>, maybe we can dream some more another time.~
@2670 = ~You know where I'd like to go most, <CHARNAME>? I'd love to go sailing. Not as a working sailor--just to explore the seas. It'd be so free... just me and the wind and the waves... (sigh)~
@2671 = ~Mmm. N... No... NO!! KEITA! KEITA!!~
@2672 = ~Fade! Wake up! You're having a nightmare.~
@2673 = ~(pick up a stick and throw it at her) Fade! Shut up! Some of us are trying to sleep.~
@2674 = ~(go over to her, but wait and see if she wakes up by herself)~
@2675 = ~(Her eyes snap open, but she doesn't seem to recognise you. She pulls a knife from her belt. Obviously still half-trapped in her nightmare, she lunges for you)~
@2676 = ~By the Gods, Fade, what are you doing?!~
@2677 = ~(try to grab her wrist) Fade, it's me! Wake up!~
@2678 = ~What the... are you insane?!? What in the Nine Hells do you think you're doing?~
@2679 = ~(She sits up with a jolt, a dagger in her hand) Huh?~
@2680 = ~You were having a nightmare. Are you all right?~
@2681 = ~I told you to shut up. I'm trying to sleep. If you're going to make such a racket, you can sleep elsewhere.~
@2682 = ~You were having a nightmare... is that a dagger in your hand? You pulled a *dagger*? What were you going to do, stab me? I'm glad I threw the stick now.~
@2683 = ~(She continues to thrash about, and continues to moan and shriek disjointedly about someone called Keita. With a scream she suddenly she sits bolt upright, and looks around her, bewildered and panting. You then realise that she is crying)~
@2684 = ~It's okay now, Fade, you're awake. It was just a nightmare.~
@2685 = ~Why are you blubbering? It was just a nightmare, nothing worth getting upset over. If I knew you were going to crack up on me, I wouldn't have bothered coming over.~
@2686 = ~Fade, it's me. Are you okay?~
@2687 = ~What? (she glances down at her hand, and with a look of horror, drops the dagger)~
@2688 = ~Oh, gods, no... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean... ~
@2689 = ~Why did you do that? You were having a nightmare. I was only trying to wake you.~
@2690 = ~It's okay, Fade, you were having a nightmare. You're awake now. There's no need to apologise.~
@2691 = ~What the in the Nine Hells are you playing at? Why are you getting upset? You were just about to disembowel me, or at least make the attempt!~
@2692 = ~(With a scream she wrenches her wrist from you, and turns on you with renewed purpose. Suddenly she stops and looks around her, bewildered)~
@2693 = ~Where is... what happened? Why am I... (she glances down at the dagger, and a look of horror creeps across her face)~
@2694 = ~What am I doing? Oh, gods, I'm so sorry. I thought... but it was so real... ~
@2695 = ~(She shakes her head, as if trying to dislodge the last remnants of the nightmare, and then looks at you, her eyes bright with tears) I can't apologise enough.~
@2696 = ~You were having a nightmare... a pretty nasty one too, by the look of it. You don't need to apologise.~
@2697 = ~What are you doing? Have you totally lost it?!~
@2698 = ~You attacked me, Fade. Why did you do that? I know you were having a nightmare, but I was only trying to wake you.~
@2699 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, I truly am. The dreams, they can be so real... when I'm in their grip, I can't break free! All I can see is her bleeding on the floor, knowing there is nothing I can do... ~
@2700 = ~What? Who is bleeding on the floor? Is it "Keita"? Is that who you are talking about, Fade? You're not making much sense.~
@2701 = ~I'm sorry, Fade. I was just startled, that's all. You don't need to apologise.~
@2702 = ~Well, you can go and sleep elsewhere. I don't need to be attacked by a psychotic elf who doesn't know what's real and what's in her dreams!~
@2703 = ~(At first she shrinks away from you, her obvious fear and uncertainty making her wary, but then buries her head in your shoulder. She is trembling and is obviously trying to suppress a sob)~
@2704 = ~I'm sorry! I can't help it... I try to block them out, the dreams, but they surface over and over. All I can see is her lying on the floor, bleeding... and there's nothing I can do! All I can do is watch... ~
@2705 = ~Who is lying on the floor, Fade? Is it "Keita"? You kept on calling out for someone called Keita. I've never heard you talk about her before.~
@2706 = ~It's okay, you're awake now. It was all just a nightmare, it can't hurt you... ~
@2707 = ~What are you talking about? Surely you know that what is in your head isn't real, and that it's nothing worth getting upset about. Come on, pull yourself together!~
@2708 = ~How... how can you say that? You have no idea... ~
@2709 = ~No. You're not worth it. Only she was ever worth it. I... I think I'm going to sleep elsewhere. Please, don't bother with me if I wake you again. As you said yourself, it's not worth it.~
@2710 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, I am... I will be fine. I'm sorry that I woke you.~
@2711 = ~It's all right, there's no need to apologise. It was just a nightmare, it can't hurt you.~
@2712 = ~Who's Keita? You kept muttering something about someone called Keita. I've never heard you mention them before.~
@2713 = ~As you should be! Maybe you should sleep elsewhere, so you don't disturb me further.~
@2714 = ~I'm really, really sorry, <CHARNAME>, but when you've lived on the streets, you soon learn... I really didn't realise it was you! I would never... the dreams can be so real sometimes. She's lying there, on the floor, there's always blood, and there's nothing I can do! Nothing!~
@2715 = ~But I do need to apologise! I... I attacked you! It's a reflex you see, from when I lived on the streets... but that doesn't make it right! I shouldn't have... I would never... it's the dreams, they can be so real sometimes. I can't help her, I can't go to her. She is just lying there, bloodied and beaten... there's nothing I can do!~
@2716 = ~Keita? I was talking about Keita?~
@2717 = ~I couldn't save her! I... I... should have, though! She was everything to me... but now she's gone, and it's my fault!~
@2718 = ~I can't talk about this now... I can't... it's too much. I'm sorry, but I can't!~
@2719 = ~(She clings to you) Please don't leave me, <CHARNAME>... ~
@2720 = ~It's all right. You can tell me another time, if you want to. Just lie down, I won't leave you.~
@2721 = ~What has gotten into you, Fade? Why are you being so clingy? I can see your dream upset you, but surely you know what's in your head isn't real, that it's not worth getting upset about. Come on, now, pull yourself together!~
@2722 = ~I won't leave you, but you have to tell me what this is all about. Please?~
@2723 = ~(As if in a daze, Fade gathers her things and moves away from the rest of the group. As she leaves, she gives you a look that is full of both profound hurt and bitterness)~
@2724 = ~But it *does* hurt, <CHARNAME>. I can't escape it! Sometimes I feel as if I'm haunted. I... I can't explain it better than that. Keita was everything to me... and now she's gone.~
@2725 = ~Thank you... for understanding.~
@2726 = ~(She curls into a tight ball next to you, with her head on your shoulder, and closes her eyes. Slowly you feel her relax as she begins to trance again, and gradually the haunted look on her face gives way to a much more peaceful visage)~
@2727 = ~I really can't tell you... not now. Later, when I've had time to... please?~
@2728 = ~Okay, I don't want to push you. Tell me when you're ready. Come on now, lie down, I won't leave you.~
@2729 = ~No, Fade. Tell me now. If you won't, it's obviously not worth it.~
@2730 = ~<CHARNAME>, I would like to thank you regarding your patience with me, especially after... the other night. I understand that you must be curious about everything, and I... I feel I can trust you. That I can tell you about Keita.~
@2731 = ~Of course you can trust me. I must admit, I am curious about Keita. You hardly ever mention her, yet your dreams are obviously haunted by her. Who is she?~
@2732 = ~Curious? Hardly. I couldn't care less who Keita is. Now stop bothering me and fall back into line.~
@2733 = ~Fade, I'm glad you feel you can trust me and everything, but now really isn't the best time to discuss this.~
@2734 = ~Not "is", <CHARNAME>. "Was". Who Keita "was".~
@2735 = ~She was everything. My friend, my soul, my sister, my guidance. If it wasn't for Keita, I surely wouldn't be here now. We were slaves together... sold together. We were both considered oddities... exotics. She was a half-drow--they are very rare. Keita herself explained to me that most half-drow children are killed as abominations, but as soon as her "family" realised they could make a profit out of her, she was sold along with a handful of unwanted male drow children. When we first met... ~
@2736 = ~(Her voice breaks and a single tear rolls down her cheek)~
@2737 = ~(wipe the tear away and hold her hand)~
@2738 = ~(do nothing, just keep listening)~
@2739 = ~Okay, Fade, I've changed my mind. I don't really want to hear the rest of this. I know your life has been tragic and all, but is all this melodrama really worth it?~
@2740 = ~(For a moment you think she is about to burst into tears, but then to your surprise, she lunges forward and slaps you hard across your face)~
@2741 = ~How dare you! How dare you speak as if Keita never mattered! I guess I was wrong about you... you are nothing more than a spoilt, pampered brat who thinks of no one but himself!~
@2742 = ~No other time will be right to discuss this, <CHARNAME>. Not for me. I... I have to tell you now. I don't think I could bring myself to try again.~
@2743 = ~Okay, Fade, tell me. This obviously means a great deal to you. Who is Keita?~
@2744 = ~I said I don't have the time! It has to wait.~
@2745 = ~(Initially she shies away from you, as if ashamed of her tears, but then laces her fingers with yours and smiles wanly)~
@2746 = ~When we first met, she was the only one who cared. She was the first slave who spoke to me. She kept me safe, in a fashion. I have no doubt I would have been slain as a troublemaker otherwise. I did everything I could to make life difficult. It was Keita made me realise that raging and attempting to slaughter everyone who came within five feet of me was only earning me beatings.~
@2747 = ~She used to tend my wounds after they had finished with me. Luckily we were bought by the same person... a Pasha from Calimshan. He was... cruel.~
@2748 = ~(She hangs her head, pulls her hand from yours and turns away from you)~
@2749 = ~Fade, you have nothing to be ashamed of. Whatever happened, it wasn't your fault.~
@2750 = ~(gently pull her round and wrap her in a hug) You did what you had to do. You can't keep blaming yourself, whatever happened.~
@2751 = ~Please, continue. What happened next?~
@2752 = ~Melodrama?! How many times have *you* had to watch one of your loved ones be raped and tortured over and over, all as punishment for something *you* have done? How many times have your eyes been forcibly opened to witness their repeated violation? And then been left to tend their wounds, only for them to forgive you, to apologise to you for what they had done?~
@2753 = ~(step forward and pull her against you) I... I had no idea, Fade... ~
@2754 = ~I find that very unlikely, Fade. If they had wanted to punish you, they would have beaten you, not your friend.~
@2755 = ~I didn't realise, Fade, and I'm sorry for that. What you went through must have been awful, but it's in the past now. You really should learn to move on.~
@2756 = ~Fine! At least now I know there's room for only one person in your life--yourself!~
@2757 = ~But it *was* my fault. I wouldn't behave--I kept raging out of control. It was fine for the gladiator pit, but when it came to the harem... Pasha Domiguez had spent a lot of money on me. No one else had a Fey'ri in their possession, and he was damn well determined to get his money's worth out of me.~
@2758 = ~They used to try to punish me... to break me... with beatings, torture and... worse, but I had built up a wall of rage. Nothing they did touched me. I didn't care what they did, whether I lived or died. I just knew I had to fight until the bitter end. I wouldn't be broken like some domesticated beast!~
@2759 = ~Keita despaired. She would treat my wounds and try to convince me to calm down, to behave myself. It was during this period that we became closer.~
@2760 = ~I understand. The two of you against the world. No wonder you sought solace in each other.~
@2761 = ~Closer? What do you mean?~
@2762 = ~I would have thought forming any kind of relationship would have been the last thing on your mind, to be honest. I thought you would have concentrated on finding a way to escape. I would have.~
@2763 = ~(Initially she roughly pushes you away, but with a sob she then flings her arms around your neck and buries her face in your shoulder)~
@2764 = ~But the blame lies with me! It was my fault. If I had behaved, they wouldn't have punished her. I kept raging out of control. It was fine for the gladiator pit, but when it came to the harem... Pasha Domiguez had spent a lot of money on me. No one else had a Fey'ri in their possession, and he was damn well determined to get his money's worth out of me.~
@2765 = ~(She drags a hand across her eyes, dashing away her tears, and steps back from your attempt to apologise and comfort her. After giving you a long, measured look, she takes your hand and starts to draw circles on your palm with her fingers)~
@2766 = ~You can't keep blaming yourself like this, Fade. I suppose I can see why you do it, but you're allowing yourself to be eaten up by guilt. I'm sure Keita wouldn't have wanted you to live your life this way.~
@2767 = ~So they used Keita to get to you. That is vile indeed. But how did they know? How did they find out?~
@2768 = ~So what happened next? How did Keita... die? Was it the torture?~
@2769 = ~So you don't believe me? You've seen my scars--I was punished plenty! But I didn't care. The only thing I cared about was Keita... and they knew it!~
@2770 = ~So now you have the whole tale. Make of it what you will. I won't bother you anymore!~
@2771 = ~Move on? How? Maybe I'm not as strong about these things as you are, <CHARNAME>. The torture of my loved one and her eventual death as we finally managed to escape is obviously a weakness, then. Well, strong one, I shall return to the ranks of your minions and continue being weak.~
@2772 = ~Yes, it was solace, though not in the way you might think. The last thing either of us needed was any kind of... physical relationship. I've never had anyone in my life to love, nor to love me. Keita was like the sister I never had. We knew that this kind of closeness would cause problems if we were ever found out, but we... needed each other. It seemed to make the risk worthwhile. Or so we thought.~
@2773 = ~How did the Pasha find out about the two of you?~
@2774 = ~Is that how Keita died then? Through the torture?~
@2775 = ~Well, knowing the risks, don't you think it was a bit... foolish to allow yourself to become vulnerable like that? Not only for yourself, but for Keita too?~
@2776 = ~We became very close, though not in the way you might think. The last thing either of us needed was any kind of... physical relationship. I've never had anyone in my life to love, nor to love me. Keita was like the sister I never had. We knew that this kind of closeness would cause problems if we were ever found out, but we... needed each other. It seemed to make the risk worthwhile. Or so we thought.~
@2777 = ~Like I could choose! Do you think I revelled in the knowledge that if we were found out... (shudder) Of course we thought of escape! Together we plotted and schemed--fruitlessly, as it happens. But when we were together, we could almost forget our predicament. Almost.~
@2778 = ~So how did the Pasha find out about the two of you, then?~
@2779 = ~Did the Pasha go too far and kill Keita through torture then?~
@2780 = ~I still think you had your priorities wrong. You allowed yourself, and Keita, to become ridiculously vulnerable. I wouldn't have done that. You really need to move on.~
@2781 = ~I know. I try to look to the future, to escape from my guilt... but I can't help think "what if". What if I had behaved from the start? What if I hadn't given in to the feelings? What if I hadn't tried to escape? Would Keita still be alive? Would I still be a  slave? I... I get so confused about it all sometimes. All I know is Keita is dead, and I couldn't save her.~
@2782 = ~So, how did Keita die? Was it... the torture?~
@2783 = ~I suppose I know how you feel. I've lost many friends, and I cannot help but feel responsible in some way. But I try not to let it rule my life. You have to accept what has happened, and move on. You cannot change the past.~
@2784 = ~We were betrayed by another slave. They thought to curry favour with the Pasha. They didn't confront us. We were left on our own for a while. I remember thinking it was strange... normally we only managed to steal moments together in the dead of night, but we were left together for a whole afternoon.~
@2785 = ~They watched as we spoke of our feelings, of our hopes and fears for the future. After that, they knew what to do... they knew how to cow me. Keita was always biddable. She did as she was told without question. I was told her torture and brutalisation would stop if I did as I was told--but it didn't.~
@2786 = ~As it turned out, the Pasha had a predilection for sadism, and he seemed to revel in our anguish. He kept us together, knowing we would blame ourselves, knowing that it would tear us apart. That was when we decided that there was nothing else to do. We had to escape.~
@2787 = ~And how did you escape?~
@2788 = ~No, the torture didn't kill her. They used that initially to keep me under control... but also because the Pasha developed a taste for it. He promised that he would stop punishing Keita if I behaved in a manner more befitting for the harem. He lied.~
@2789 = ~I should have known--he was a sadist through and through. He loved the power it gave him. I should know, I've seen it enough in my people's eyes. No matter what I did, how biddable I was, he continued alternately to punish first Keita and then myself, making the other one watch. It was unbearable.~
@2790 = ~Our chance for escape came when he took a liking to the 15-year-old daughter of one of the jailers, Ophelia. He demanded she be brought before him. Brennan, the jailer, knew he would be killed if he refused and his daughter taken away regardless, so foolishly he brought her in.~
@2791 = ~She was put to work in the harem immediately. I used to hear her begging her father to get her out of there, but he was too frightened of the Pasha. Eventually, Keita and I came up with a plan of sorts--we'd all escape together. As a gladiator, my weapon skills were well-honed, and Keita insisted she had previous experience with a blade... we could hold any guards off for as long as was necessary and together we could all seek sanctuary somewhere.~
@2792 = ~With hindsight, I can see it was a poor plan, but we were desperate. It took a lot of convincing to make Brennan see it our way, but eventually his obvious love for his daughter won over his fear. As jailer he had the keys, so our previously impossible task of escaping the cells was now simple.~
@2793 = ~Escaping the palace was much more difficult. Keita and I managed to dispatch most of the guards we came across. We soon realised that staying together made us easier to catch, so I ran ahead with Ophelia in tow. Brennan stayed with Keita.~
@2794 = ~We met up outside the palace... but Brennan was alone. He told me they had come across some resistance, and that Keita had fallen, shot in the back with a crossbow. As... as she stumbled... she vowed she would never be recaptured, and... and turned her dagger on herself.~
@2795 = ~There was nothing I could do. For years I blamed Brennan--he should have brought her body to me--but he was just a weak, terrified man. I tried to go back for her, but more guards poured out of the palace--I couldn't take them all on!~
@2796 = ~Still I fought. I must have been knocked unconscious because the next thing I knew I was in a Calimport slum dwelling with Ophelia tending my many wounds. I couldn't stay there, not with the man who abandoned my only love to die. So I left, alone. The rest you know.~
@2797 = ~But you're not alone, Fade. We're... I'm... here for you now. Please don't ever forget that.~
@2798 = ~That's truly awful, Fade. To go through all that, only to lose her at the end. But you came through it all. Remember, you're not alone anymore.~
@2799 = ~I know it was foolish! Do you think I had a choice? She meant everything to me. Love is not an emotion Fey'ri are normally familiar with. I didn't know what to do, nor how to feel. She gave me something I'd never had before--a true friend, a sister. When we spoke, we could almost forget about our situation during our few precious moments together. Almost.~
@2800 = ~It was very tenuous. Our chance for escape came when he took a liking to the 15-year-old daughter of one of the jailers, Ophelia. He demanded she be brought before him. Brennan, the jailer, knew he would be killed if he refused and his daughter taken away regardless, so foolishly he brought her in.~
@2801 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>, and I must thank you for listening. I haven't really shared that with anyone before. I don't want to unburden on you, but it does help to have someone to talk to. I feel as if something that was festering inside me has now been expunged. I don't trust easily, as you can probably imagine... but I do trust you. Thank you.~
@2802 = ~It was all my fault. I wouldn't behave--I kept raging out of control. It was fine for the gladiator pit, but when it came to the harem... Pasha Domiguez had spent a lot of money on me. No one else had a Fey'ri in their possession, and he was damn well determined to get his money's worth out of me.~
@2803 = ~<CHARNAME>, I just want you to know that I am very grateful to you for listening to me last we spoke. I have never really discussed Keita with anyone before, and speaking to you... it's almost as if a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.~
@2804 = ~Think nothing of it. I'm just glad that it's made you feel better.~
@2805 = ~Fade, you don't need to be grateful. I'm your friend, and friends are here to help you get over such things.~
@2806 = ~You're not still going on about her, are you? I thought we'd sorted that out.~
@2807 = ~It has. I've carried the guilt of her death for so long now, it was almost like a... like a festering wound, one that has now been cleaned and may be able to heal properly at last.~
@2808 = ~Disgusting analogy, but I know what you mean. You needn't be grateful. I'm your friend, and that's what friends are for.~
@2809 = ~So you may be able to get on with your life now, and learn to forgive yourself. As I said last time, you've nothing to feel guilty over. Stop punishing yourself.~
@2810 = ~(Her smile widens, her eyes bright with emotion. She steps towards you and takes your hands in hers) It means so much to me to hear you say that, <CHARNAME>. True friends are hard to come by, especially ones that will listen to you whinge and moan about so much!~
@2811 = ~(pull her to you and wrap her in a hug) You really shouldn't put yourself down in such a way, you know? What happened to you and Keita was atrocious, and yet here you are, going strong.~
@2812 = ~Oh, come now, Fade. Stop it. Such self-pity is unbecoming, and I don't expect it from you.~
@2813 = ~I... I was actually thanking you for helping me, <CHARNAME>, but if you're going to be an arse about it, you can just bugger off.~
@2814 = ~It's hard, <CHARNAME>, but I will try. Such behaviour soon becomes habit. (sigh) You must be absolutely sick and tired of my whining.~
@2815 = ~(She says nothing at first, but hugs you back fiercely. After a long moment, she releases you and smiles)~
@2816 = ~Keita would have liked you. I'm absolutely sure she would have approved of our... friendship. She wouldn't have wanted me to live like that. Remembering her only in death does no justice for who she was in life. You've made me realize that now. Maybe I can move on. For the first time, I'm actually looking forward to the future.~
@2817 = ~And why not?~
@2818 = ~Fade, pack it in. Such a maudlin attitude is unbecoming of you.~
@2819 = ~(She narrows her eyes for a moment, and you wonder if you've pushed her too far this time. Then, to your relief, she grins)~
@2820 = ~Once again, my friend, you're absolutely right. Keita would have liked you. I'm absolutely sure she would have approved of our... friendship. She wouldn't have wanted me to live like that. Remembering her only in death does no justice for who she was in life. You've made me realize that now. Maybe I can move on. For the first time, I'm actually looking forward to the future.~
@2821 = ~(yawn) <CHARNAME>, can we take a break?~
@2822 = ~No, we've got too much to do. Sorry.~
@2823 = ~Maybe in a little while. Just not now.~
@2824 = ~(She smiles happily as everyone settles down for an impromptu break, and then takes her boots off to let her feet cool)~
@2825 = ~(go over and sit with her)~
@2826 = ~(You find yourself rather enjoying this unexpected moment of relaxation, just sitting around and letting your mind drift. After a short while, Fade puts her boots back on, gets up and signals to you that she's ready to continue on your journey)~
@2827 = ~(sigh) But I'm sooo tired!~
@2828 = ~Stop whining, Fade.~
@2829 = ~You're going to do this until I let you take a break, aren't you?~
@2830 = ~(ignore her and continue on)~
@2831 = ~(sigh) Okay... ~
@2832 = ~... ~
@2833 = ~What about now? I'm so tired... ~
@2834 = ~(She grins disarmingly at you as you sit next to her) My feet are weird, aren't they?~
@2835 = ~That is quite possibly the most bizarre thing anyone has ever asked me, Fade.~
@2836 = ~Errr... okay. If you say so.~
@2837 = ~(grin) I'll only stop whining if we can take a quick break.~
@2838 = ~I'm not going to win this, am I? You are going to keep whinging until I let you have your own way, as per usual, aren't you?~
@2839 = ~Oh, how can I resist that grin? Okay, we'll take a break.~
@2840 = ~I said no, and I mean no. No matter how much you whine and sulk I'm not stopping, so you may as well shut up now. Okay?~
@2841 = ~What do you take me for, <CHARNAME>? Of course!~
@2842 = ~Okay, we'll take a break then.~
@2843 = ~(Obviously realizing that you are not going to stop, Fade sighs grumpily and makes her way back to her place in the marching order)~
@2844 = ~Is it? I was just looking at my feet and... they're weird. By your standards, anyway.~
@2845 = ~Fade, I'm not looking at your feet. Why are we even having this conversation? This is just too bizarre!~
@2846 = ~By my standards? What do you mean?~
@2847 = ~Why do you keep going on about your feet?~
@2848 = ~(sigh) Yes, I'm the Queen of Bizarre, aren't I? All right, then, <CHARNAME>. We'd better be on our way.~
@2849 = ~(You look at her feet, and realize exactly what she is talking about. She only has four toes on each foot, and her toenails are black and have an almost talon-like quality to them)~
@2850 = ~Eww! That is quite possibly the most disgusting thing I have ever seen!~
@2851 = ~Now that's something you don't see everyday.~
@2852 = ~They are! By your standards, anyway. Go on, look.~
@2853 = ~Fair enough. I was only asking.~
@2854 = ~(Obviously not expecting your vehement response, she contrives to cover her feet up with her hands)~
@2855 = ~I know they're a bit odd, but do you have to be *quite* so insulting?~
@2856 = ~Sorry, Fade. It was just a bit of a shock, that's all. I sometimes forget that you're not just a regular elf with a tail. You haven't got any more unusual... added extras, have you?~
@2857 = ~Come on, Fade. Give me some credit. It's not every day that you get someone shoving their feet in your face, only to find out... to find out... ~
@2858 = ~A bit odd? That's an understatement! Now I know why I hardly ever see you with your socks off. I can just about handle the tail, but that's a bit too bizarre for me.~
@2859 = ~Nope. (she looks up at you, almost apprehensively)~
@2860 = ~I know why you're doing this, and I'm not bothered by your tail, nor your scales, and I'm not bothered by your feet, either. We can't help they way we're made, nor the scars we bear from simply living our lives.~
@2861 = ~They are... pretty unusual, that much I can say.~
@2862 = ~(chuckle) Yes, they are, aren't they? But enough about me. Have *you* got anything odd concealed under that tunic of yours?~
@2863 = ~Well, I don't really have anything naturally odd, but I do have a rather impressive scar.~
@2864 = ~Actually, I do. (lift your tunic) See?!? Weird!~
@2865 = ~I know. Lots of people make that mistake. (she looks up at you, almost apprehensively)~
@2866 = ~Find out what? That the person you're talking to is some kind of freak?~
@2867 = ~No, you're not a freak. I know why you're doing this, and I'm not bothered by your tail, nor your scales, and I'm not bothered by your feet, either. We can't help they way we're made, nor the scars we bear from simply living our lives.~
@2868 = ~No, you're not a freak. Just that your feet are... pretty unusual.~
@2869 = ~I wish I'd never shown you now.~
@2870 = ~I know why you're doing this, and I've gotten used to your tail, and your scales, so I'll get used to your feet as well. We can't help they way we're made, nor the scars we bear from simply living our lives.~
@2871 = ~So do I, Fade. I don't think I'm ever going to be able to forget this.~
@2872 = ~Wait, Fade. I didn't mean anything bad by that. Just that your feet are pretty unusual, that's all.~
@2873 = ~Well, if you can't... best that we don't have so much to do with each other in future, isn't it? I thought you could accept... but I see I was wrong. We'd better be on our way, <CHARNAME>. I think I've had enough of a break.~
@2874 = ~Am I that transparent? But... thank you, all the same.~
@2875 = ~(She picks at the corner of your tunic) So... how about you? Anything odd that you've got concealed under there? Or am I alone the Queen of Weird?~
@2876 = ~Impressive? Now this I have to see.~
@2877 = ~(lift your tunic, showing a row of nasty-looking puckered scars arranged in a crescent shape) I got bitten by a basilisk.~
@2878 = ~(stand up, grin, and begin to unlace your britches)~
@2879 = ~(hold up your hand) I'm missing the top part of my finger. See?~
@2880 = ~She looks at your torso, and then looks up at you enquiringly) I... I don't see anything weird, <CHARNAME>.~
@2881 = ~You don't? How can you miss it? It's my belly button. It sticks out!~
@2882 = ~Oh. Okay, then.~
@2883 = ~Really? A basilisk? You were lucky not to be turned to stone.~
@2884 = ~(She examines your torso) Ouch, that must have hurt quite a lot! (she runs a finger along the outline of the bite mark)~
@2885 = ~Yes, it did hurt quite a bit. Still aches sometimes too.~
@2886 = ~Well, I was kind of unconscious at the time, so I don't remember a great deal of it. I woke up after the healer had finished. I had quite a lucky escape.~
@2887 = ~Err... <CHARNAME>, what are you doing?~
@2888 = ~Like I said, showing you something impressive.~
@2889 = ~Well, my scar is on my hip, and I can't show you if... You did ask to see it!~
@2890 = ~Do you want to see it or not?~
@2891 = ~Oooh... <CHARNAME>! How did you do that? I've never noticed it before.~
@2892 = ~I lost it a fight. A bar brawl, actually. Nothing to be proud of, but... ~
@2893 = ~It got bitten off! By a... err... a dog.~
@2894 = ~In the pursuit of derring-do, my dear.~
@2895 = ~Ooookay... yes, it does indeed stick out! Errr... and that's weird?~
@2896 = ~Yep. Stickie-out belly buttons are always seen as odd.~
@2897 = ~Okay, so it's not in your league, but it's the best I can do.~
@2898 = ~Awww... you don't have to be embarrassed because you're uniformly perfect.~
@2899 = ~Perfect, eh?~
@2900 = ~Fade, stop it.~
@2901 = ~Oh, you poor, brave soldier! Does it need to be kissed better?~
@2902 = ~Fade, don't take the piss!~
@2903 = ~I'm sure that will help.~
@2904 = ~So it seems! At least you're okay now, and you've got something to impress the girls with.~
@2905 = ~There's only one girl I want to impress.~
@2906 = ~I suppose so. Never thought of it like that.~
@2907 = ~That's not the only thing I've got to impress the girls with.~
@2908 = ~Hmmm... who could that be now, I wonder? Come on, King of Weird, we'd better get going.~
@2909 = ~Well, now you are! Come on, then, I think we've rested enough. Let's get going, shall we?~
@2910 = ~Impressive, huh? Maybe I should be the judge of that.~
@2911 = ~(As you lower the side of your britches to expose a long, jagged scar, she gasps and winces) Okay, I take that back! That *is* impressive! How in the Hells did you do that?~
@2912 = ~I was playing up a tree with Imoen. I was about 12, I guess. I fell out of it, and hit a branch halfway down. The branch got stuck in my hip and I was kind of hanging there by my skin--I got into loads of trouble because I should have been studying! Taught me a lesson about climbing trees, though.~
@2913 = ~I said it was! What did you think I was about to show you, then?~
@2914 = ~No, go on. Show me then.~
@2915 = ~(As you lower the side of your britches to expose a long, jagged scar, she gasps and winces) That's pretty impressive, <CHARNAME>! How in the Hells did you do that?~
@2916 = ~That depends *entirely* on what "it" is you're showing me.~
@2917 = ~(lower your britches enough to expose a long, jagged scar)~
@2918 = ~If you're going to make lewd insinuations, I'll go and show my impressiveness to someone else.~
@2919 = ~You want to see *that*? Well, if you insist.~
@2920 = ~That's pretty impressive, <CHARNAME>! How in the Hells did you do that?~
@2921 = ~Ah, well, you could lie about losing it in some fearsome battle. It would give you something to impress the girls with!~
@2922 = ~Oh, poor brave soldier! Would a kiss make it feel better?~
@2923 = ~Derring-do? For some inexplicable reason, I get the feeling you're telling porkies.~
@2924 = ~I'm not! I lost it in a most righteous... umm... bar brawl, actually. Okay, so maybe that's not something I'm particularly proud of.~
@2925 = ~Okay, okay, it got bitten off by a dog. But it *was* a particularly vicious brute.~
@2926 = ~They are? Then you definitely have the... strangest belly button on all Faerun!~
@2927 = ~(She pokes it and giggles, and in retaliation, you poke back at her. Laughing, she ducks out of the way)~
@2928 = ~All right, all right. Stop horsing around, King of Weird! Isn't it time we got going?~
@2929 = ~Well, it's not your fault that you're uniformly perfect.~
@2930 = ~Oh, stop it. You've had your daily allowance of compliments.~
@2931 = ~(She pokes her tongue out at you and begins to pull her boots on) Come on, we'd better get going.~
@2932 = ~Why, are you blushing? Oh, you're just too sweet!~
@2933 = ~(She leans over and places a light kiss on your cheek, making you blush even more furiously)~
@2934 = ~I'm not! But if you ever do need anyone to ever kiss it better... ~
@2935 = ~(She gives you one last lingering look, and then begins to pull her boots on) Come on, we'd better get going.~
@2936 = ~(She shakes her head, grinning, but does lean forward and place a light kiss on you) There, all better now?~
@2937 = ~Much better.~
@2938 = ~Not quite.~
@2939 = ~I'm sure it isn't... ~
@2940 = ~I'm sure it has--don't climb them!~
@2941 = ~Nah. Don't climb them with Imoen after you've spent the morning teasing her and she's just spent a rather busy last half an hour partially sawing through some of the branches!~
@2942 = ~Exactly. Stick to more... earth-bound pursuits, huh Fade?~
@2943 = ~I wasn't sure. It could have been anything, knowing you!~
@2944 = ~(chuckle) You know what? You are possibly the most *terrible* man I have ever met, <CHARNAME>. But do go on... show me your "impressiveness".~
@2945 = ~(She shrieks and covers her eyes) <CHARNAME>! Are you so determined to get me into trouble?!~
@2946 = ~I don't know. Depends on what kind of trouble you're thinking of... ~
@2947 = ~No! I was only joking!~
@2948 = ~Good. But if it ever, you know, gives you any more trouble... ~
@2949 = ~(She quirks an eyebrow and gives you one last lingering look, and then begins to pull her boots on) Come on, we'd better get going.~
@2950 = ~(She purses her lips and tries to smother a smile) Don't push your luck, <CHARNAME>!~
@2951 = ~Only joking? That's a shame.~
@2952 = ~Serve you right! From what you've told me of Imoen, teasing her only gets you about ten times what you give. Come on, we'd better get going.~
@2953 = ~(You hear Fade singing, her voice a soft contralto, obviously amusing herself. You do not recognize the song, and many of the words are replaced by "la's" and hums. Occasionally you even hear her mutter "can't remember that bit... " and then continue on with her song)~
@2954 = ~What are you singing?~
@2955 = ~(chuckle to yourself and shake your head)~
@2956 = ~Fade, shut up. You can't even remember all the words!~
@2957 = ~What? Oh. Nothing really. Just a silly tavern song. I can't even remember half the words. Was I bothering you?~
@2958 = ~Well, it was a bit... distracting.~
@2959 = ~No, not really. You have a nice voice. I never knew you could sing.~
@2960 = ~Yes. Shut up.~
@2961 = ~Lalala--what?~
@2962 = ~Well, you could at least learn the words. Why don't you sing a song you know?~
@2963 = ~Oh. I was only singing to amuse myself, but if you don't like it, I'll be quiet.~
@2964 = ~Oh. Was it really that bad?~
@2965 = ~No, you have a very nice voice. It's just that hearing you mutter "what were the words again?" every other line... why don't you just sing a song that you know?~
@2966 = ~No, not at all. It's just that you're distracting me from what I should be doing again. You seem to have made a habit of doing that recently.~
@2967 = ~Yep, sorry. I get the feeling that every enemy in the vicinity knows we're here now. Well done.~
@2968 = ~Th-thank you, <CHARNAME>. I don't sing often, and hardly ever in company. I don't know what came over me... why I should sing now.~
@2969 = ~I don't mind. It makes a welcome distraction. You seem to have made a habit of doing that recently.~
@2970 = ~People normally sing like that when they're happy.~
@2971 = ~I don't know. But maybe in the future you could pick a song you know better? Hearing you mutter "what were the words again?" every other line does kind of ruin it.~
@2972 = ~I don't know many songs, to be honest with you. The Fey'ri have little use for them, other than battle chants, and I'd rather not sing anything I learnt in Calimshan. Maybe you could teach me a song?~
@2973 = ~Okay then. How about this?~
@2974 = ~Oh, I don't know, I'm not very good at this kind of thing.~
@2975 = ~So why *are* you laughing at me?~
@2976 = ~I'm not laughing at you, not at all! It's just that... you could sing a song that you know.~
@2977 = ~I'm not laughing at you. It's just that you're distracting me from what I should be doing. Again. You seem to be making a habit of that.~
@2978 = ~I'm not laughing at you. You have a very nice voice.~
@2979 = ~Really? So what else have I done recently to... distract you?~
@2980 = ~Ahhh... nothing in particular.~
@2981 = ~Oh, nothing in particular. You know, walking, talking, the way your tail twitches when you get excited or annoyed, the way you play with your hair when you're feeling nervous... and especially the way you unbuckle your armour at night.~
@2982 = ~Oh, and I suppose having you traipsing around the countryside, with your pontificating and meddling hasn't already alerted any enemies to our location?~
@2983 = ~(She gives you a rather venomous look, and mutters something you don't understand under her breath)~
@2984 = ~I guess they do, <CHARNAME>. I guess they do.~
@2985 = ~(She touches your arm, almost hesitantly) Do you know any good songs? Ones that you could... maybe teach me?~
@2986 = ~No, I don't. Sorry. Maybe I'm not as happy as you are.~
@2987 = ~I'm sure I've heard that somewhere before, but with *slightly* different words. I'm sure the girl in the song had raven hair... ~
@2988 = ~Nope. Not in my song. In my song, she had fiery hair.~
@2989 = ~Possibly. I really can't remember.~
@2990 = ~I'm sure you'll do fine.~
@2991 = ~No, I really can't sing at all. I'm sorry.~
@2992 = ~(She runs a hand up the back of your neck, making you shiver) Nothing in particular? That's a shame. Well, maybe you could think of something later, and let me know then... ~
@2993 = ~(She runs her hand up the back of your neck, making you shiver) So, you've been watching me undress at night? You should have said. I could have given you a more... private viewing.~
@2994 = ~I see. Maybe another time.~
@2995 = ~(She touches her own red hair and smiles self-consciously) Stop teasing me, <CHARNAME>.~
@2996 = ~(take her hand and brush a lock of hair from her face) I'm not teasing you, Fade.~
@2997 = ~Teasing? This? No, *this* is teasing... ~
@2998 = ~That's rich! You ask me to sing a song I know all the words to, and then you sing a song you don't know all the words to! But... thank you anyway.~
@2999 = ~(She gives you a lingering look, and there is no doubt in your mind that she knows the changing of the words was deliberate)~
@3000 = ~(sigh) That's okay. I suppose singing isn't for all of us. Maybe you have some other... talent you'd like to share with me at some point.~
@3001 = ~And I'm glad of that <CHARNAME>, I really am.~
@3002 = ~(She then pauses, and a rather devious smile curls at the corner of her lips) Well, about this, anyway. Sometimes a girl likes to be teased... ~
@3003 = ~(You trace a finger along her jaw line and then across her bottom lip, and draw her in closer to you. Her breathing quickens, and you feel her shiver slightly) I... see your point, <CHARNAME>.~
@3004 = ~(Fade listens intently as you begin your song)~
@3005 = ~"There is a tavern down the road called The Devil's Crow
I used to drink and sing there a few short years ago 
But upon one night I lost the will to ever again return 
If you'd like I'll tell you the tale so that ye might learn"~
@3006 = ~"Oh the lasses there were pretty and with them I had reached some fame
But there was one alone who I could never quite tame 
A devilish smile, fiery hair and an evil eye 
To see the rest of this lass, I knew I'd die"~
@3007 = ~"I tried and tried to catch her favour day after day
But she wouldn't budge, always turned away 
Until one night she took my hand, "follow me" she said 
She led me upstairs to the rooms and threw me upon a bed"~
@3008 = ~"Now stories about this girl had been told from harbour to home
So I wasn't surprised when she pinned me down and her hands did roam 
Across my arms and hands then she went into my waist 
Only to remove my coin as she laughed in my face"~
@3009 = ~"I tried to bring my arms to wrestle her away
She had tied them to the bed, I guess I was going to stay 
She got up and opened the door 
She winked, left the room and I saw her nevermore"~
@3010 = ~(As you settle down to rest, you notice Fade sitting a little way from the rest of you, writing in a little book. She obviously senses your gaze, because she looks up at you and smiles)~
@3011 = ~Just jotting down the day's... misadventures, <CHARNAME>. Nothing to be worried about.~
@3012 = ~You keep a journal too, huh?~
@3013 = ~A journal? Can I read it?~
@3014 = ~Why should I be worried?~
@3015 = ~It's not really a journal. It's just somewhere I can write down my thoughts. I find it helps to sort them out.~
@3016 = ~Come on then--let me see!~
@3017 = ~I've never seen you writing in it before. What kind of thoughts do you need to sort out, then?~
@3018 = ~I know what you mean. I keep one too. I'll let you read mine if I can read yours.~
@3019 = ~Oh. Is that all? Well, don't be too long. The scritching of that quill is beginning to annoy me intensely.~
@3020 = ~(grin) No! It's personal!~
@3021 = ~Oh, come on, just a peek. Or do you have something to hide?~
@3022 = ~Personal, you say? Come on, then, hand it over! I want to find out what you really think of me!~
@3023 = ~Personal? What kind of things do you write in there, then?~
@3024 = ~No reason. I mean, I'm not writing anything negative about you or anything. Or... or anyone else, for that matter.~
@3025 = ~You're not writing anything negative? How about positive, then?~
@3026 = ~Come on then, hand it over. I want to see what you really think of me!~
@3027 = ~Oh, you know... this and that. Feelings, ideas... anything, really.~
@3028 = ~Well, now I'm really curious. Come on, hand it over.~
@3029 = ~Well, I'm sold. Come on, let me have a look.~
@3030 = ~Feelings, eh? What kind of feelings?~
@3031 = ~No, I'd rather not. It's a bit... personal.~
@3032 = ~Personal? Now I have to have a look!~
@3033 = ~Really? Well, I wouldn't want to bother you, would I?~
@3034 = ~(She puts the quill and journal back in her pack, and turns her back on you)~
@3035 = ~Like I'd tell you that!~
@3036 = ~Well, now I have to know what you've written in there.~
@3037 = ~Come on, Fade, play fair.~
@3038 = ~(She laughs as you try to reach round her, trying to prise her fingers from the journal, almost wresting it from her for a moment. Suddenly you both become aware of your close proximity. Fade glances away, biting her bottom lip. You feel her fingers curl round yours)~
@3039 = ~(lean in and kiss her gently)~
@3040 = ~No, this has gone too far. I'm sorry, Fade.~
@3041 = ~(She looks back at you, her expression shifting from confusion to hurt. Abruptly she pulls away from you, and you think you catch the glint of tears in her eyes)~
@3042 = ~Yes, I... I agree, <CHARNAME>. This has gone entirely too far. Excuse me. I... really should go and... and get some rest.~
@3043 = ~(She giggles and shakes her head, putting the journal behind her back. You reach round her, trying to prise her fingers from the journal, almost wresting it from her for a moment. Suddenly you both become aware of your close proximity. Fade glances away, biting her bottom lip. You feel her fingers curl round yours)~
@3044 = ~(You feel her recoil slightly as your lips meet, but just as you think she is going to pull away entirely, she leans into you again, accepting your kiss. You feel her run a hand up the side of your neck, and she gently tugs on your earlobe as her own kisses become more urgent, allowing you to entwine your tongue with hers)~
@3045 = ~(After a while you break apart, and as you stroke her cheek, she smiles almost coyly back at you, but says nothing)~
@3046 = ~Are you okay, Fade?~
@3047 = ~Well, that was certainly enjoyable. But we really should join the others before they wonder what we've been up to.~
@3048 = ~Come on. We'd better get back to the others before they wonder where we are.~
@3049 = ~Why shouldn't I be okay?~
@3050 = ~(She looks at you intently, and then shakes her head and chuckles) Can't get anything past you, can I? (sigh) I've had some pretty nasty experiences in the past involving men. I know I shouldn't tar you all with the same brush, but... Let's not spoil the mood, huh? I'm even beginning to remember that all men aren't complete bastards, because of you.~
@3051 = ~Why, thank you, Fade. That's possibly one of the biggest compliments anyone has ever paid me. But we really should join the others before they wonder what we've been up to.~
@3052 = ~And why would you think that? What kind of "nasty experiences" are we talking about here?~
@3053 = ~(You stand up and offer her your hand, which she accepts. As she begins to stand, you haul her up so she falls forward into your arms. She shrieks slightly as she falls forwards, and then swats you playfully once she finds her feet again, giving you a mock-disapproving look)~
@3054 = ~You're not funny, you know. That's the oldest trick in the book! Come on, jester. We'd better get back to the others.~
@3055 = ~I think you can guess. I was a slave, remember? I really don't want to think about it right now.~
@3056 = ~I can understand that. I'm sorry I brought it up. We really should join the others before they wonder what we've been up to.~
@3057 = ~I can understand that. I'm sorry I brought it up. Perhaps we should join the others before they wonder where we are?~
@3058 = ~(The day has been hard, and you decide it is time for a little breather. You sit down and reach for your waterskin, slaking your thirst. Fade wanders over and sits down next to you. She says nothing and smiles rather awkwardly, obviously remembering your last encounter)~
@3059 = ~(Offer her your waterskin)~
@3060 = ~Are you okay?~
@3061 = ~(Get up and move away from her)~
@3062 = ~(She continues to smile, and takes your proffered waterskin. She takes a huge gulp, and then hands it back. You cannot help but notice the slightly nervous edge to her voice when she speaks) Thanks.~
@3063 = ~No problem.~
@3064 = ~(Small roses of colour rise on her cheeks) I'm fine.~
@3065 = ~(She pauses and seems to study her fingernails for a moment) We... don't seem to have spoken much recently, have we?~
@3066 = ~Not much.~
@3067 = ~Well, we've been busy.~
@3068 = ~Nope, and that's the way I like it.~
@3069 = ~(She gets up and follows you) <CHARNAME>, we really need to speak about this! It was... just a kiss.~
@3070 = ~Just a kiss? What do you mean by *just* a kiss?~
@3071 = ~I know, and now I regret it. I should never have allowed it to happen. I'm sorry, Fade, but I can't carry on like this.~
@3072 = ~(Both of you sit there, an uncomfortable silence between you. Fade then sighs)~
@3073 = ~<CHARNAME>... about the other day. We don't seem to have spoken much since then.~
@3074 = ~Not since... you know.~
@3075 = ~Not since we kissed, you mean.~
@3076 = ~Yeah, I know. Can we please drop it?~
@3077 = ~I know. It just seems that since we shared that kiss, things haven't been... quite the same between us. It was just a kiss, after all.~
@3078 = ~Oh. I see. I take it you regret what happened, then.~
@3079 = ~Yes, I do. I should never have allowed it to happen. I'm sorry, but I can't carry on like this.~
@3080 = ~Yes, I do. I'm sorry, Fade, but I'm not interested in you in that way. What happened the other night was a mistake. One I don't plan on making again.~
@3081 = ~I didn't mean it to sound like that, <CHARNAME>. It's just that if you... regret it, I don't want it to get in the way of our friendship.~
@3082 = ~Of course I don't regret it. I was kind of hoping something like this might happen between us. Do you regret it?~
@3083 = ~Yes, I do regret it, but I agree that it shouldn't become an issue between the two of us. Lets just chalk that one up to experience, okay?~
@3084 = ~It has already got in the way of our friendship, Fade. I'm sorry, but I don't think it can ever be the same between us again. It should never have happened--it was a mistake.~
@3085 = ~Fine. So we can't even be friends, then. Well, if that's the way you want it, that's the way you'll get it. Consider me warned off.~
@3086 = ~Yes. Do you... regret it?~
@3087 = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't want to embarrass you, but we really should talk about this, before it gets blown out of all proportion.~
@3088 = ~Fade, I think you've already done that yourself. I don't know what it meant to you, and I agree that it shouldn't become an issue between the two of us. Lets just chalk it up to experience, okay?~
@3089 = ~Please, just let me deal with this in my own way, I don't regret what happened, not at all. I just find it this kind of thing hard to talk about, that's all.~
@3090 = ~But I don't want to talk about it. It was a mistake.~
@3091 = ~Of course I don't regret it. I was just worried that I'd made a fool of myself. Again. It wouldn't be the first time.~
@3092 = ~No, you haven't made a fool of yourself. And to prove it... ~
@3093 = ~I know that sentiment well. I was worried about the same thing!~
@3094 = ~Okay. We can still be friends though, so that's... good. Fine.~
@3095 = ~Yes. I can see now that it was a mistake. I'm glad that's out of the way now. Let's just continue on. I won't be troubling you again.~
@3096 = ~That's... very sweet, <CHARNAME>.~
@3097 = ~(She moves closer to you and loosely wraps an arm around your waist) I'm glad you don't regret it. I was worried I'd made a complete fool of myself. It wouldn't be the first time.~
@3098 = ~No, you haven't made a fool of yourself. I'm just unused to such a show of emotion.~
@3099 = ~(You feel her smile under your lips, and she responds to your kiss with enthusiasm. When you eventually break apart, she grins cheekily at you)~
@3100 = ~You know, this gets better each time.~
@3101 = ~(kiss her again)~
@3102 = ~And is that meant to be a compliment?~
@3103 = ~Good, but we can't spend the day dallying here. Come on.~
@3104 = ~Business as usual, <CHARNAME>? Don't worry. I'm sure we can find plenty of opportunities for... dallying... in the near future.~
@3105 = ~You never have to worry about that with me, <CHARNAME>. Ever.~
@3106 = ~(lean over and kiss her)~
@3107 = ~I'm glad to hear that, Fade. I really am.~
@3108 = ~I'm glad too, <CHARNAME>. All this is a little... overwhelming, isn't it? But I'm glad too... ~
@3109 = ~That's okay. Not everyone feels comfortable with such things. Maybe it is something you will get more used to with time.~
@3110 = ~I'm sure I will, Fade.~
@3111 = ~So am I, <CHARNAME>. And I'd be happy to help you... get used to it.~
@3112 = ~(This time you take things slower, turning Fade's teasing methods on to her. When you break apart, she is looking rather pink and flustered, her pupils huge within her crimson eyes, her tail making a sinuous dance behind her. Her smile has now lost its cheeky edge, taking on a somewhat more hungry bearing. When she speaks, her voice is low and husky)~
@3113 = ~Now *that* kind of behaviour could get a boy into serious trouble.~
@3114 = ~Most definitely, <CHARNAME>... and I look forward to testing out my little theory in the near future!~
@3115 = ~<CHARNAME>, may I ask you something... personal?~
@3116 = ~I suppose that depends on what it is.~
@3117 = ~Okay. Shoot.~
@3118 = ~No.~
@3119 = ~I suppose I just wondered... have you... ever been in love before?~
@3120 = ~Of course I have. Why do you ask?~
@3121 = ~No, I haven't. Why do you want to know?~
@3122 = ~I thought I was, once. But now I realize it wasn't the real thing.~
@3123 = ~I really don't want to answer that, Fade.~
@3124 = ~I fall in and out of love all the time, Fade.~
@3125 = ~I... I just wondered. Have you... ever been in love before?~
@3126 = ~Oh. Are... are you sure? I... only wanted to satisfy my own curiosity. It's nothing drastic.~
@3127 = ~Okay, now you've piqued my own curiosity. What is it?~
@3128 = ~You can satisfy your curiosity elsewhere, because I am no longer interested in you or what you have to say.~
@3129 = ~Well, I suppose it would depend on what you wanted to know.~
@3130 = ~Just, you know, curious.What were they like? If you don't mind me asking, of course... ~
@3131 = ~Of course I don't. She was my first real love, and her name was Calia. We were together for about a year. I was about 17.~
@3132 = ~No, of course I don't. I fell in love with one of the stable boys, called Jak. I was about 16 or 17, I suppose.~
@3133 = ~What was Kirsten like? She was great. I had the hugest crush on her, but it wasn't reciprocated. I worshipped the ground she walked on, but she never even noticed me.~
@3134 = ~Ahhhh, my first love. He may have been fat and furry, but I loved him all the same.~
@3135 = ~You haven't? That... surprises me, <CHARNAME>. I would have thought that you wouldn't have had any problems finding love.~
@3136 = ~Why not? It may come as a surprise to you, but I wasn't always this buff and bronzed demi-god you see before you today. I was actually very bookish, and the idea of talking to girls just terrified me.~
@3137 = ~Heh, I didn't say I had any problems in finding love, I've just never really felt anything other than lust for any of my partners.~
@3138 = ~I've never gone looking for love, so there's no reason why I have found it. I suppose I've always believed that when it happens, it happens.~
@3139 = ~Truly? What made you realize that?~
@3140 = ~Simple, really. I've come to have feelings for someone else, and they are far stronger than anything I have ever felt before, ergo I can't have been in love before.~
@3141 = ~Because I'm older and wiser now. For love to be real, it has to be reciprocated.~
@3142 = ~Because I was just a kid!~
@3143 = ~Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. Maybe I could ask you something else then? Something a little less personal?~
@3144 = ~Okay, as long as it *is* less personal.~
@3145 = ~Fade, I know your game. You'll just ask me the same thing again, but in a different way. So let me set it straight--I don't want to discuss such feelings with you, ever. Okay?~
@3146 = ~You do? How many times?~
@3147 = ~Three or four times a day, normally. Bar wenches, girls walking down the street, tough mercenary girls, all tooled up and ready to fight--I love them all!~
@3148 = ~Fade, I wasn't being serious! I've only ever been properly in love once before.~
@3149 = ~I'm joking, Fade! To be honest, I've never been in love before. Not properly, anyway.~
@3150 = ~(Her face falls, and then her tail twitches and her features stiffen) Fair enough. At least I know where I stand now.~
@3151 = ~What went wrong, then? Why did you break up?~
@3152 = ~She ran off with the blacksmith's son one day. Turns out she'd been seeing him behind my back. I was pretty devastated.~
@3153 = ~We just drifted apart after a while. Although at the time I loved her very much, I suppose it was inevitable that we would split up. We were very young.~
@3154 = ~I... err... ended it.~
@3155 = ~The stable... boy? I see. Were your feelings... reciprocated?~
@3156 = ~No. I don't think he knew I even existed. Well, not in that way, anyway, He married his childhood sweetheart not long before I left Candlekeep.~
@3157 = ~Yep. Many a happy afternoon was spent tumbling in the straw.~
@3158 = ~Errr... no. I don't think he would have appreciated my interest in him.~
@3159 = ~That's a shame. I hope she now realizes what she was missing.~
@3160 = ~I doubt she even remembers me! We were only seven, after all.~
@3161 = ~And why do you say that?~
@3162 = ~Well, considering she was one of my tutors, I really do doubt it.~
@3163 = ~I'm sorry... did you just say "fat and furry"?!~
@3164 = ~Yes. My first love was my pony, Misty. I loved him so much!~
@3165 = ~Well, you didn't specify *what* my first love had to be.~
@3166 = ~(laugh) I see! But you must have felt something for... someone, once? You can't still be terrified of girls!~
@3167 = ~No? Says who?~
@3168 = ~Heh, no, not anymore. To be fair, I've had my fair share of crushes, but nothing serious. (sigh) Nobody loves me... ~
@3169 = ~Women have always been these strange, alien creatures to me. I doubt I'll ever understand them, and they'll terrify me even when I'm an old man!~
@3170 = ~Well, at least you're honest. And... I suppose that's a sentiment I can relate to. But if you've never been in love, how do you know... when it happens?~
@3171 = ~Well, if it happens, I'll be sure to let you know.~
@3172 = ~Easy. Your palms sweat, you feel ever so slightly sick all the time, you find it hard to catch their eye without blushing and you find yourself wondering exactly what they look like under all that armo-- (cough)~
@3173 = ~I think you just... know. It's like an instinct.~
@3174 = ~Are you trying to tell me that you don't know what it feels like to be in love?~
@3175 = ~And... how will you know when it has happened?~
@3176 = ~I... see. So what are these... feelings like?~
@3177 = ~Well, your palms sweat, you feel ever so slightly sick all the time, you find it hard to catch their eye without blushing and you find yourself wondering exactly what they look like under all that armo-- (cough)~
@3178 = ~Yes, I suppose it does. Unrequited love can be very cruel, can't it?~
@3179 = ~You know what it feels like? To love someone who doesn't love you?~
@3180 = ~Yes, it can. I hope it never happens to me again.~
@3181 = ~Oh, I see! So it was nothing more than a schoolboy crush, then?~
@3182 = ~You seem relieved, Fade.~
@3183 = ~Yes. Since then, I've been too busy to fit anyone else into my life.~
@3184 = ~Oh, believe me, at the time I thought it was the big "L", but now I know different. I've come to have feelings for someone else, and they are far stronger than anything I have ever felt before, ergo I can't have been in love before.~
@3185 = ~Well... and this is just hypothetical, of course, I don't mean this to apply to you personally or anything... how do you know when you love someone? What does it... feel like?~
@3186 = ~"Hypothetically"? Fade, that's just as personal as the last question you asked me! Let me set it straight for you--I don't want to discuss such feelings with you, ever. Okay?~
@3187 = ~Hypothetically? Okay... well... your palms sweat, you feel ever so slightly sick all the time, you find it hard to catch their eye without blushing and you find yourself wondering exactly what they look like under all that armo-- (cough)~
@3188 = ~(grin) Oh, stop mucking about, jester! You know what I mean.~
@3189 = ~Okay, okay, I'll be serious. I've only ever been in love once before.~
@3190 = ~Alright. Seriously, I've never been in love before. Not properly, anyway.~
@3191 = ~Can I ask you about it? What were they like? If you don't mind, of course... ~
@3192 = ~That's awful. Has it put you off... finding love with anyone else?~
@3193 = ~What is this? Twenty Questions?~
@3194 = ~What? Put me off?~
@3195 = ~A bit. No one likes getting hurt, but you can't help who you fall in love with.~
@3196 = ~Or maybe that is just what happens when you've been with the same person for a long while. You just drift apart.~
@3197 = ~I don't think that's true, Fade. I firmly believe that once you've found that special person, you'll be with them forever.~
@3198 = ~Maybe so. And you might get run over by a runaway cart tomorrow. All the more reason to live life to the full!~
@3199 = ~That's a very negative attitude to true love, Fade.~
@3200 = ~You ended it? Why?~
@3201 = ~I got bored. Simple really. We were young, she wanted to settle down, and I wanted to travel. It was inevitable.~
@3202 = ~She... caught me out. I was cheating on her. I ended it before she could.~
@3203 = ~Oh. I suppose I hadn't even considered you the type who would, you know... ~
@3204 = ~Be interested in another man? Why not? Why cut yourself off from half the population, just because they are the same sex as you?~
@3205 = ~Why not, Fade?~
@3206 = ~Well, I'm not. Not normally, anyway. Jak was... special to me. He's the only bloke I've ever... felt that way about. I don't know why.~
@3207 = ~You... did? Oh. I suppose I hadn't even considered you the type who would, you know...~
@3208 = ~Ahhhh... I see. Although I hadn't even considered you the type who would, you know...~
@3209 = ~Only sev--what? (She looks confused, but then laughs) Stop mucking about, jester! You know what I mean. I'm not talking about childhood infatuations!~
@3210 = ~No? Only adult ones, then.~
@3211 = ~Okay, okay, a sensible answer. My first real love was a girl called Calia. We were together for about a year. I was about 17.~
@3212 = ~Okay. I suppose my first love was when I fell in love with one of the stable boys, called Jak. I was about 16 or 17, I suppose.~
@3213 = ~(blush) Oh, you know... nothing in particular... just that... ummm... ~
@3214 = ~Hmmm? Just that what, Fade?~
@3215 = ~It's okay, Fade. I shouldn't have put you on the spot like that.~
@3216 = ~Your tutor--what? (She looks confused, but then laughs) Stop mucking about, jester! You know what I mean. I'm not talking about childhood infatuations!~
@3217 = ~What? (She looks confused, but then laughs) Stop mucking about, jester! You know what I mean. I'm not talking about childhood infatuations!~
@3218 = ~(grin) Oh, come now, <CHARNAME>. After the way you've... behaved around me? You're not scared of girls!~
@3219 = ~Oh, that just means I'm not scared of you. (try to pinch her cheeks)~
@3220 = ~Okay, maybe not now, but I used to be. To be fair, I've had my fair share of crushes, but nothing serious. (sigh) Nobody loves me... ~
@3221 = ~I... I wouldn't say that, <CHARNAME>. (Her cheeks flush, and she bites her bottom lip as she hurries away)~
@3222 = ~(giggle) I'm sure you'll meet one who convinces you otherwise, <CHARNAME>.~
@3223 = ~I think I already may have done, but I'm not sure if she realizes it yet.~
@3224 = ~Oh? And what makes you say that?~
@3225 = ~I doubt that! But that won't stop me from loving her, all the same.~
@3226 = ~(She gives you a confused look) Uh... okay, <CHARNAME>. Whatever you say... ~
@3227 = ~Hmm. Maybe you could add the urge to be near them every second of the day, but as soon as you do get near them you end up prattling on about nonsense to them all the time, and being excruciatingly embarrassed by this, but unable to stop... ~
@3228 = ~Uh, yeah. You get the idea.~
@3229 = ~Why do you want to know anyway? Don't tell me you don't know what it's like to be in love.~
@3230 = ~Are you taking the piss, Fade?~
@3231 = ~So even if you'd never been taught, you would know what those feelings meant? You wouldn't be able to... mistake them, would you?~
@3232 = ~Well, I suppose you could. It depends. What kind of feelings are you talking about here?~
@3233 = ~What's wrong, Fade? Are you trying to tell me that you don't know what it's like to be in love?~
@3234 = ~I... I don't know. No one has ever explained how it's meant to feel. I could just have bad indigestion, for all I know. (grin)~
@3235 = ~I have heard many descriptions of how it feels to be in love, but "bad indigestion" isn't one! Although feeling slightly sick can be part of it, as can sweaty palms, finding it hard to catch their eye without blushing and finding yourself wondering exactly what they look like under all that armo--ahem!~
@3236 = ~So you think you're in love with someone? Can I... ask who that lucky individual is?~
@3237 = ~I'm not entirely sure. It depends entirely on whether the other person feels the same way. I... think they may do, but I can't be certain.~
@3238 = ~They do rather like to tease me, you know, and since I'm not really familiar with such... (shrug) Let's just say that I dearly hope they feel the same way, and leave it at that.~
@3239 = ~I suppose that depends on who you choose to give your heart to, doesn't it? (She gives you an odd smile before returning to her place in the formation)~
@3240 = ~Well... I suppose, in a way, I am. I wouldn't like to hear of anyone having to suffer through unrequited love. It can be very cruel.~
@3241 = ~So, you know what it feels like? To love someone who doesn't love you?~
@3242 = ~Yes, it can. Even though I was only young, I hope it never happens to me again.~
@3243 = ~No! Not at all. Like I said, I am merely curious. If you don't like it, I won't bother you anymore.~
@3244 = ~No, Fade. It's okay to be curious. I suppose I was put off the whole love thing for a while. It just seemed another thing I could do without in my life. But you can't help it when you do fall in love, nor who you fall for.~
@3245 = ~Fade, it's not that you're bothering me as such, it's just... it's like you're using me to analyse something. Is there something you want to tell me?~
@3246 = ~Well, being knocked back like that. Once bitten, twice shy and everything.~
@3247 = ~I suppose so. I was put off the whole love thing for a while; it just seemed another thing I could do without in my life. But you can't help it when you do fall in love, nor who you fall for.~
@3248 = ~What are you getting at? It's like you're using me to analyse something. Is there something you want to tell me?~
@3249 = ~Yes, shy. And... unable to get to the point.~
@3250 = ~(She offers you a strange half-smile) You do? Well, that's... comforting to know.~
@3251 = ~I suppose it is. Don't let anything hold you back, right? (She gives you an odd smile and returns to her place in the formation)~
@3252 = ~(shrug) I suppose I just need someone to prove me wrong then, don't I? (She gives you an oddly penetrating look and smiles)~
@3253 = ~You... cheated on her? Well, at least you're honest about it.~
@3254 = ~Fade, it's not something I'm particularly proud of, and I wouldn't do it again. I could never put someone I cared for through that again.~
@3255 = ~These things happen, Fade--fact of life. I never intended to hurt her, it just happened.~
@3256 = ~(sigh) Oh, I agree with you. It's just that I... I suppose I don't like the thought of *anyone* else sharing y-- (She stops and looks to you rather apprehensively, as if she has only just realized what she was about to say)~
@3257 = ~But I'm just prattling on now! I'll just... all right? (She gestures away from herself and offers you a strange half-smile)~
@3258 = ~Well, after... after the other day. You did kiss me.~
@3259 = ~I'm not attracted to people because of their gender, Fade. I never have been. Why cut yourself off from half the population, just because they are the same sex as you?~
@3260 = ~I did. And as I told you then, I don't regret it; not at all.~
@3261 = ~Yes, I did. I've been thinking a lot about that kiss. I should possibly have told you this before, Fade, but I'm not that interested in women. I like you a lot--just not in the way you probably want me to.~
@3262 = ~So, people of the female persuasion do get a look in with you? That's... good to know. It's nice to know that you have loved another, but I was a bit worried for a moment. I thought that maybe you'd only kissed me to... ~
@3263 = ~(shrug) Well, it doesn't matter now. (She gives you an odd smile and returns to her place in the party formation)~
@3264 = ~(grin) Possibly, depending on what they are and who they are with. (She offers you an odd smile and returns to her place in the party formation)~
@3265 = ~(blush) Because... because you're quite a... special person, <CHARNAME>. To a lot of people. And... to me.~
@3266 = ~No, it's okay. I kind of set myself up for that one, didn't I? You're quite a... special person, <CHARNAME>. To a lot of people. And... to me.~
@3267 = ~(She laughs and bats your hands away from her face) You say that now, but just you wait! I can be ultimately scary when I want to be!~
@3268 = ~Although you can be pretty frightening yourself. And not just in the "Son of Bhaal" kind of way. Also in the "messing with people's feelings" kind of way, too.~
@3269 = ~Oh, I think she does, <CHARNAME>. I just think that she is worried about making an idiot of herself. And that she is worried that she may possibly be getting hold the wrong end of the stick. I... dearly hope she's right, though. I don't know how she would react if she found out she was wrong.~
@3270 = ~Because you deserve someone who does, <CHARNAME>. Someone to convince you that not all of us are terrifying, alien creatures. Someone... close to you.~
@3271 = ~So do I, <CHARNAME>. I just hope you're willing to give her a chance.~
@3272 = ~Good. And I'm absolutely positive that she'll do everything in her power to... help you get over your irrational fears. If you just give her a chance.~
@3273 = ~Get the idea? I think I understand it quite well by now. I... I never imagined, though, that I... that... Well, that it would feel so much like being sick!~
@3274 = ~(She flashes you a quick grin, though for some reason not quite meeting your eyes, and returns to her place in the party formation)~
@3275 = ~Of course not, <CHARNAME>! I understand too well what you're going through to tease you like that. Because I've... I... well... It feels a lot like being sick, don't you think?~
@3276 = ~Well... feelings. I don't have to draw you a picture, do I? Just that you feel close to someone, and you want to be with them all the time, and... and... Oh, now you're getting me mixed up, <CHARNAME>! I'll have to take a moment to sort all these thoughts out!~
@3277 = ~(She gives you a rather self-conscious smile, and hurries back to her place in the party formation)~
@3278 = ~Of course you can ask--but I'm not telling you! Not now, anyway. Maybe... maybe later, when I've worked up the courage to... And when I do, <CHARNAME>, I promise, you'll be... the first to know, all right?~
@3279 = ~No, that's true. You can't help it. I mean, I never imagined when I first joined your party that I would--would--~
@3280 = ~(She stops short, a distinct blush rising in her face) You know what, <CHARNAME>? I forgot what I was about to say! Adventuring does sap your memory, doesn't it? Come on, we'd better be on our way!~
@3281 = ~Something to tell you? Does it... does it really sound like that, <CHARNAME>? Then... I... well... then I must not be making very much sense, must I? Come on, we'd better be on our way before I start spouting gibberish!~
@3282 = ~Yes. That's... that's exactly how I feel, at times... ~
@3283 = ~(The two of you stand there in awkward silence for a while, until Fade flashes you a quick grin, though for some reason not quite meeting your eyes) Well, this isn't getting us anywhere, is it? Come on, we'd better get going.~
@3284 = ~Well, in that case, some good has come out of it, hasn't it? And... and I hope, too, that the next person who... who falls in love with you, won't have to go through that again.~
@3285 = ~"Just happened"? I hope that's not the excuse you're going to tell the next woman who gives her heart to you, <CHARNAME>. And in fact, I hope... I hope you won't ever *need* to tell her that excuse.~
@3286 = ~And I've told you that I... don't regret it either. I'm not sure how much it meant to you, but for me, I... Well, I suppose we'll have to sort this out someday, won't we?~
@3287 = ~Oh. So it's... like that? This is... a bit much for me to wrap my mind around it now, <CHARNAME>. I mean, after all we've been through and all, I thought... Well, I'm glad you've set it straight now, at least. We're... still friends, of course. Right?~
@3288 = ~But if you did meet somebody worth loving, wouldn't you... make time for them? Not that I mean anything like... that I'm saying... it was... just a thought. After all, you never know, do you?~
@3289 = ~(You notice that Fade has been a little preoccupied all day, and keeps coming over to you as if she wants to say something, but walking away at the last moment, giving you long and thoughtful looks each time. After a while she makes her way back to you again, and opens her mouth as if to say something, but then looks around at your companions nearby, shakes her head and walks away again. But this time the look she throws you is lingering and full of longing--it is obvious she wishes to speak to you, but in a slightly more private setting)~
@3290 = ~(follow her)~
@3291 = ~(leave her alone)~
@3292 = ~(She stops a little way from the rest of the group and turns. She is smiling, but it is a nervous smile, with none of the usual teasing undertones)~
@3293 = ~I am... glad you chose to follow me, <CHARNAME>. I did wonder if you would take the hint. I... I... ~
@3294 = ~(She sighs and smiles nervously again, and then begins to play with a lock of her bright crimson hair. You wait for a moment, but it is obvious that she is unsure of what to say next)~
@3295 = ~Fade, come on, spit it out. Why did you drag me over here?~
@3296 = ~Well, if you're going to play stupid games, I'm going back to the others.~
@3297 = ~What's up, honeykitten? You seem a bit out of sorts.~
@3298 = ~(As soon as she realises you're not following her, she quickly comes back to the group and gingerly touches your arm) <CHARNAME>... may we speak? Privately?~
@3299 = ~Not now. I'm really quite busy.~
@3300 = ~I... didn't intend to drag you over here. And I don't think I'm... ready to share my thoughts with you at the moment. I'm sorry for having bothered you.~
@3301 = ~No, I'm sorry. I meant it in jest, I wasn't being serious. I should probably learn to read situations a bit better, huh?~
@3302 = ~What's wrong now? You've been acting weird all day, then you obviously want to tell me something, so I follow you, and then... you've got nothing to say! Come on, Fade, you've got to give me something to work with here.~
@3303 = ~So you drag me over here and then tell me you're not ready to tell me whatever it is that you so obviously want to share! Make up your mind! I'm not telepathic, you know! Well, I'll tell you something. I'm not interested, okay?~
@3304 = ~I'm fine. Yes... fine. I... I... just have something to tell you.~
@3305 = ~Oh, why is this so hard? You would have thought it would be the easiest thing in the world.~
@3306 = ~What's so hard? You know you can tell me anything. I will listen.~
@3307 = ~What's so hard, honeykitten? Nothing is worth agonising over this much, surely.~
@3308 = ~Talking to yourself is the first sign of madness, you know. Maybe you should tell me whatever it is on your mind, get it out in the open. You'll feel better afterwards, believe me.~
@3309 = ~Fine, then. Wouldn't want to bother you.~
@3310 = ~Honeykitten? Where did that come from? I've been called many things in my life, but never that!~
@3311 = ~Seems like an appropriate nickname for you, if you ask me.~
@3312 = ~Oh, nothing. I don't know why I called you that. Just a silly nickname, you know. Seemed like the right thing to say.~
@3313 = ~Just a nickname. I don't mean anything by it. What did you want to say?~
@3314 = ~<CHARNAME>, this really is quite important to me.~
@3315 = ~All right, if it means that much to you.~
@3316 = ~Fade, I said no and I mean no! What the hell could be so important that it warrants such secrecy?~
@3317 = ~Apology accepted. Maybe I shouldn't be so sensitive. It's just that... what I have to tell you... is serious. Very serious, okay?~
@3318 = ~Okay, Fade, I understand. So what is it you have to tell me?~
@3319 = ~I don't like where this is going. I'm sorry, Fade, but I have to stop you there. Whatever it is you want to confess, I don't think I want to know. I value your friendship and all, but... sorry.~
@3320 = ~So I'm weird, huh? I was trying to work up the courage to... to... tell you something important, and all you can do is insult me?~
@3321 = ~Fade, that's not what I meant! I meant you've been acting weird, all jumpy and over-sensitive. And I don't mean that to insult you. I'm just saying that you're not yourself. So, what's wrong?~
@3322 = ~Fine, fine. So, what *is* wrong?~
@3323 = ~Good! I'm glad you're not interested! And to think I actually thought I loved you, you self-absorbed, self-important bastard! Well, now I know, <CHARNAME>. Thanks for opening my eyes before I made a total fool of myself!~
@3324 = ~Love? Oh, Fade. I'm so sorry. I'm tired and cranky, and I know that's not much of an excuse. In fact, it's no excuse. And, well, you're not making a fool of yourself. Not at all. Quite the opposite, really.~
@3325 = ~This was going to be some feeble confession? Well, I'm sorry to piss on your bonfire, Fade, but it was never going to happen. You're good for a laugh and all, but me and you, in love? I don't think so.~
@3326 = ~I know you will. It's just... this doesn't come easily to me.~
@3327 = ~I... I don't know how to say this, so I'll keep it short. I... I think I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@3328 = ~(sigh) What do I mean, "think"? I know. I... love you.~
@3329 = ~I love you too, Fade. With all my heart. (kiss her gently on the lips)~
@3330 = ~Fade, I'm really sorry, but I don't feel the same way about you. I value you as a friend and a travelling companion, but nothing more. I'm sorry.~
@3331 = ~You WHAT? I'm sorry, Fade, but I fear you have misinterpreted me here. You're useful, but you mean nothing more to me.~
@3332 = ~So I'm mad, huh? No, you don't have to answer that. Although it has been compared to madness before. Love, that is.~
@3333 = ~Love? And in what context?~
@3334 = ~Love? I see. Maybe we should stop this conversation now, before anything regrettable is said. I'm sorry.~
@3335 = ~Love? I hope I understand you correctly, Fade. Because if I don't, then I'm about to make the biggest fool of myself. I love you.~
@3336 = ~Don't... don't mock me, <CHARNAME>. Especially now.~
@3337 = ~I'm sorry. Please, continue.~
@3338 = ~I'm not mocking you, Fade. It's the truth. Now what is it you want to say?~
@3339 = ~(She blushes slightly and smiles. You both look at each other awkwardly for a moment, then look downwards. She then shrugs, sighs and then chuckles to herself)~
@3340 = ~Oh. I... err... I... ~
@3341 = ~Yes?~
@3342 = ~Can you get to the point already? Talk about blood out of stones.~
@3343 = ~It does.~
@3344 = ~Because... because I can't say it... what I want to say... with everyone else around! Please understand... ~
@3345 = ~Okay, if it's that important to you.~
@3346 = ~Okay. Right to the point.~
@3347 = ~You're right. I have been acting weird. Maybe I shouldn't be so sensitive. It's just that... what I have to tell you... is serious. Very serious, okay?~
@3348 = ~Nothing!~
@3349 = ~Fine!~
@3350 = ~Nothing? So you drag me over here to tell me something, which ends up being nothing, which is obviously a lie! Make up your mind! I'm not telepathic, you know! Well, I'll tell you something. I'm not interested, okay?~
@3351 = ~If it's fine by you, it's fine by me! I can't believe I was about to tell you that--that--something you wouldn't be interested in anyway, you self-absorbed, arrogant bastard!~
@3352 = ~(She folds her arms and looks away from you, obviously upset. After an awkward moment, she looks your way, and you can see tears running down her cheeks)~
@3353 = ~I'm really sorry, Fade. I should never have spoken to you in such a way. I love you too.~
@3354 = ~Wh-what? How can you be so... so cruel?! Well, you'll be pleased to know that my "bonfire" won't be anywhere near you from now on.~
@3355 = ~(She kisses you back, softly at first, then more fervently. When you break apart, she looks to you and smiles)~
@3356 = ~I have felt the same way for... some time now. All the time I thought I might have picked up a severe case of unrequited love.~
@3357 = ~You and me both, then. Although I am glad you said something. It was getting to a point where I was considering doing something drastic to get your attention.~
@3358 = ~Shhh. You don't have to say anything more.~
@3359 = ~I... understand. It was not meant to be. Still, we can be... friends, can't we? Come, let us get back to the others.~
@3360 = ~Useful? After all we have been through together? I can understand that you... may not feel the same way I do, but I had thought us friends, at least. Obviously that is not the case! I am not a mere tool, to be used when it is deemed fit, <CHARNAME>. Goodbye.~
@3361 = ~Context? I... I would have hoped that it might have been obvious, but... ~
@3362 = ~You're no fool, <CHARNAME>. Because... I love you too.~
@3363 = ~(She leans in you and kisses you briefly, almost shyly at first, but as you respond, her kisses become more fervent. After a while, you break apart)~
@3364 = ~We... we should get back to the others now, don't you think? They will be wondering where we are!~
@3365 = ~(You offer her your hand, which she accepts, but as you walk away together, she snakes an arm around your waist. Smiling and feeling very content, you wrap your arm around her waist and both of you make very slow progress back to your other companions)~
@3366 = ~Do you... really mean that? Then this should be straightforward... but it's not.~
@3367 = ~Well, I'm sorry if I'm taking up your precious time.~
@3368 = ~You drag me over here to tell me something that's obviously bothering you and that you so obviously want to share, tell me you find it hard, and when I ask you why, you get all indignant! Make up your mind! I'm not telepathic, you know! Well, I'll tell you something. I'm not interested, okay?~
@3369 = ~(You go to her, and wrap your arms around her. At first she is unresponsive, but after a short while she hugs you back fiercely. She pulls away slightly, just enough so she can look at you)~
@3370 = ~I'm... glad. Don't ever do that to me again, though! I was so worried about telling you... but now it's out in the open.~
@3371 = ~(You lean in and kiss her again. When you break apart, she gives you a slightly amused look)~
@3372 = ~You know, I really am quite curious as to what that "something drastic" was going to be. But now we should get back to the others... they will be wondering where we are!~
@3373 = ~(You lean in and kiss her again. When you break apart, she smiles contentedly at you)~
@3374 = ~(Creeping up behind you, she tucks something behind your ear and with a swift kiss and a decidedly girlish giggle, runs away again)~
@3375 = ~(run after her)~
@3376 = ~(reach for whatever it is she tucked behind your ear)~
@3377 = ~You're in a good mood!~
@3378 = ~(She looks over her shoulder and grins at you) Can't catch me!~
@3379 = ~You want to bet on that?~
@3380 = ~But I bet I won't have to. You'll come back!~
@3381 = ~(stop running and reach for whatever it is she tucked behind your ear)~
@3382 = ~(Reaching up, you pluck the little flower she has placed there. Bringing it to your nose, you find its perfume is sweet and pungent. Looking up again, you see Fade has stopped running and is looking at you expectantly)~
@3383 = ~You seem in a good mood. What's brought this on?~
@3384 = ~(gesture for her to come over to you)~
@3385 = ~(laugh) Why shouldn't I be? (She stops, turns around and runs straight for you, wrapping you in a hug) I've got you, haven't I?~
@3386 = ~(tweak her nose playfully) And I love you too!~
@3387 = ~You certainly have. You can have even more of me later, if you'd like.~
@3388 = ~Fade, not in front of everyone else!~
@3389 = ~(You keep running after her, and with a shriek of delight, she runs on. You catch her easily however, which you realize was her intention all along. She allows your bodies' momentum to spin her around, and then she lands rather heavily on you, a huge grin on her face) So, you caught me!~
@3390 = ~Yep, although it seems as if you have caught me now!~
@3391 = ~(shove her off you and pin her to the ground) I certainly did. Now what am I going to do with you?~
@3392 = ~Oooff! Fade, be careful!~
@3393 = ~Cheeky! (She then gives you a rather calculating look and runs straight at you, knocking you off your feet and landing rather heavily on you) Got you!~
@3394 = ~(grin) You most certainly have.~
@3395 = ~(shove her off you and pin her to the ground) Now I've caught *you*. What am I going to do with you?~
@3396 = ~(With a mischievous smirk, she shakes her head) Nope, you come here.~
@3397 = ~(grin) Oh, come here. You know you want to!~
@3398 = ~Okay, have it your way!~
@3399 = ~Fade, I'm not in the mood to play silly buggers now, not in front of everyone else.~
@3400 = ~You love my nose?~
@3401 = ~Of course I do!~
@3402 = ~You know what I mean!~
@3403 = ~Really? Is that a threat or a promise?~
@3404 = ~(hold her tightly against you) Oh, a most definite promise... ~
@3405 = ~Well, that depends on what you want to be "threatened" with, doesn't it?~
@3406 = ~Well, that kind of depends on you, doesn't it?~
@3407 = ~(She smiles and shakes her head) I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I get kind of carried away sometimes. I tend to forget you are not used to such... open displays. Maybe later then?~
@3408 = ~Maybe later... what?~
@3409 = ~Yes, later is better... when there's no one else around.~
@3410 = ~I'm sure I'll get used to it with time, just not all at once, okay?~
@3411 = ~(smirk) Now then... what to do with you?~
@3412 = ~Are you open to suggestions, or do you want to see what you come... up with?~
@3413 = ~Whatever you want, Mistress.~
@3414 = ~No! Let me go! (She starts to try to wriggle away from you, but soon gives up) Okay, so you have me. What are you going to do with me?~
@3415 = ~Well, I am open to suggestions, or you could just see what I come... up with.~
@3416 = ~(say nothing, just bend your head to kiss her)~
@3417 = ~Oh, I don't know. How about this? (kiss her soundly)~
@3418 = ~Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hurt you, did I?~
@3419 = ~(shove her off you and pin her to the ground) Ah ha! That ploy always works. Now I have you!~
@3420 = ~No, but I'm not used to being cannoned into by pretty girls. Let's save the rough-housing until later when there's no one else around, okay?~
@3421 = ~No, it's okay. I'm just not in the mood to play silly buggers now, not in front of everyone else.~
@3422 = ~Really? What else do you love, then?~
@3423 = ~Well, I may have to save that for later, when we have a little less... company, if you get my meaning.~
@3424 = ~(grin and bury your head in her cleavage)~
@3425 = ~(laugh) Okay, yes I do. And I love you too, <CHARNAME>, with all my heart. (She kisses you soundly)~
@3426 = ~(Her eyes widen) Oh! I... see. Gosh! (She looks down, then looks back up at you) Yes, I would say that was a definite promise... ~
@3427 = ~(She purses her lips and gives you a slightly quirky look) I'm sure you can think of something. I'm sure you have some kind of...tool at your disposal.~
@3428 = ~(grin) Oooh, I get a choice, do I? Well, in that case, you can promise to... threaten me later, okay? (wink)~
@3429 = ~I think I can leave that up to you, <CHARNAME>. Surprise me, okay? (She winks and saunters off)~
@3430 = ~Okay, <CHARNAME>. Until later... (She blows you a kiss and saunters off)~
@3431 = ~(She smiles and kisses you on the cheek) Okay, <CHARNAME>. It isn't a problem.~
@3432 = ~You're a naughty, naughty thing, <CHARNAME>. You do realize that, don't you?~
@3433 = ~You think this is naughty? Just wait until later, then.~
@3434 = ~And you are a filthy little minx for understanding, do *you* realize that?~
@3435 = ~So the choice is mine? Hmmmm... I'll have to think on this and... come back to you later.~
@3436 = ~(She grins lasciviously and for a fleeting moment you wonder whether it was wise to let a part Tan'ari with a broad imagination have such a choice)~
@3437 = ~(Just as your lips meet, you stop short and lightly trace your tongue around her lips. She shivers and her eyes widen) <CHARNAME>! Where on Faerun did you learn to do that?~
@3438 = ~Why? Don't you like it?~
@3439 = ~Just a little... trick I picked up. Works on all kinds of lips. (grin)~
@3440 = ~(She responds eagerly, and when you break apart, she is looking decidedly flushed) You've got to stop doing that, you know. As I've told you before, you really are going to get yourself into some serious trouble one of these days... ~
@3441 = ~Hmmm... I think I do, <CHARNAME>, I think I do.~
@3442 = ~Get out of there, you dreadful thing! They aren't just there for your entertainment! (She shakes her head and sighs as you bury your face deeper) Men... I ask you... ~
@3443 = ~(grin) With bated breath, <CHARNAME>.~
@3444 = ~(She tries to look innocent, but fails miserably) Me? A filthy little minx? (grin) Most definitely, <CHARNAME>... ~
@3445 = ~Err, quite the opposite, actually... Do it again... ~
@3446 = ~(Her eyes widen, as does her grin) Really? Well, that's something to look forward to. (wink)~
@3447 = ~<CHARNAME>, love is a funny thing, isn't it?~
@3448 = ~Yes, I suppose it is.~
@3449 = ~(grin) Makes me laugh all the time.~
@3450 = ~Fade, you're not over-analysing things again, are you?~
@3451 = ~There seem to be all these unwritten rules to it, but no guidelines to what those rules actually are.~
@3452 = ~What are you getting at?~
@3453 = ~Well, I suppose the main guideline is, if it makes both of you feel good, and you're not hurting anyone else, why not?~
@3454 = ~Fade, no one knows what those rules are. We all have to find out the hard way. We don't seem to be doing too bad for a couple of rank amateurs, though.~
@3455 = ~(laugh) Jester! But there again, that's one of main things I love about you; you make me laugh.~
@3456 = ~But that's not what I meant. What I meant is that there seem to be all these unwritten rules to it, but no guidelines to what those rules actually are.~
@3457 = ~Yes, I know... I'm doing it again. But I can't help it. Everything I'm experiencing at the moment... it's all so new to me. I've literally *never* felt like this before. I'm still waiting to wake up, and to find out that none of this has happened, that it was all a dream. Everything is just so... different now.~
@3458 = ~Different? What do you mean by that?~
@3459 = ~I know, it can be a bit daunting sometimes. But you just have to go with the flow. There's no point in dissecting everything in the hope it'll miraculously make sense.~
@3460 = ~(pinch her very lightly) See? Not a dream.~
@3461 = ~We're all experiencing new things all the time, Fade. Just think of this along the same lines, and you'll be fine.~
@3462 = ~(shrug) Well, before we admitted our feelings, we were just friends, and that followed a different set of rules. Now things have changed quite a lot.~
@3463 = ~I used to hide my feelings for you, for fear that you wouldn't want me, that you wouldn't feel the same way. Now I can shout my feelings from the top of the highest peak, if I wanted to! It's a... strange feeling, <CHARNAME>.~
@3464 = ~I know, but it's not just you. I'm having exactly the same feelings, Fade. It's completely natural.~
@3465 = ~You feared that I wouldn't want you? What isn't there to want? (lean in a little closer to her)~
@3466 = ~So just go with your gut instinct, is that what you're saying? But what happens if you have a... conflict, within yourself? What if you don't honestly know what's right?~
@3467 = ~Fade, you're over-analyzing things again. Just relax!~
@3468 = ~What exactly are you getting at, my love?~
@3469 = ~Look, I'll show you what's right, okay?  (kiss her gently)~
@3470 = ~You have a conflict? What do you mean by that?~
@3471 = ~(grin) I suppose you're right there. Listen to me! You'd think that we were the only two people to ever have fallen in love.~
@3472 = ~But I feel like I'm tied up in knots here... so many conflicting emotions. I don't understand it, <CHARNAME>. I try to let things take their natural course, but what if I end up doing something wrong?~
@3473 = ~Then I'll have to show you what's right, won't I?  (kiss her gently)~
@3474 = ~Well, you're not doing anything wrong at the moment, are you? And if you do, I'll be here to help steer you right. This is a partnership, Fade. We will enjoy the good times and work through the bad times together. It's what it's all about.~
@3475 = ~(She giggles in an oddly endearing way as you pinch her) Okay, I get your point. You're about as real as they get.~
@3476 = ~I could get realer, you know... (lean in a little closer to her)~
@3477 = ~(say nothing else, just kiss her gently)~
@3478 = ~And I'm not going anywhere. As long as we keep communicating, we'll be fine.~
@3479 = ~I know, but those experiences really only refer to me--if I make a mistake, I'm only hurting myself. Where you are concerned, I'm more likely to hurt you, and I don't want to do that.~
@3480 = ~And if I like being hurt?~
@3481 = ~Fade, stop worrying. (kiss her gently)~
@3482 = ~Fade, that won't happen. As long as we keep communicating, we'll be fine.~
@3483 = ~(She smiles and kisses your cheek) I really don't deserve you, you know.~
@3484 = ~Yes you do. You deserve all of me. (lean in close to her)~
@3485 = ~(smirk) You really are quite terrible, you know that? (She leans in and kisses you)~
@3486 = ~(kiss her back enthusiastically and allow your hand to travel across her belly)~
@3487 = ~(kiss her back enthusiastically and allow your hand to travel across her buttocks)~
@3488 = ~(kiss her back and hold her tightly to you)~
@3489 = ~(You feel her lips curl into a smile as she accepts your kiss)~
@3490 = ~It's... nothing. Just something I have to work out on my own.~
@3491 = ~Fade, I'm here to help you work through these things. Please tell me what's bothering you. I promise, whatever it is, I won't laugh, or be shocked. I just need to know.~
@3492 = ~(She smiles and kisses you on the cheek) You're absolutely right, <CHARNAME>... as usual! I really don't deserve you, you know.~
@3493 = ~Yes, you're right. Communication is the key.~
@3494 = ~Fade, please tell me what's bothering you. I promise, whatever it is, I won't laugh, or be shocked. I just need to know.~
@3495 = ~(As you reach her thighs, she stiffens slightly, and then pulls away from you, a worried look on her face) <CHARNAME>... ~
@3496 = ~What's wrong?~
@3497 = ~Fade, don't you want me to do that? Don't you want... me? Is that what this is all about?~
@3498 = ~Oh, I'm... sorry. I didn't mean to do that.~
@3499 = ~(As you continue to kiss, you feel yourself begin to respond naturally to her close proximity... and it seems she notices too. With a slightly worried look, she pulls away from you) <CHARNAME>... ~
@3500 = ~I'm sorry. I can't, you know, help that! What's wrong?~
@3501 = ~Oh, I'm... sorry. I... I can't help it.~
@3502 = ~Possibly not the best of times for that to happen, but... what's wrong? Don't you want me to do that? Don't you want... me? Is that what this is all about?~
@3503 = ~(sigh) Okay, this may be difficult for you to understand, but... now we're together, there is going to be a time when... when... ~
@3504 = ~Oh, I see. When we are going to be... intimate. Well, only if you want to. Do you?~
@3505 = ~Fade, I know what you're getting at, and I know you've had a difficult time with men in the past. I wouldn't push you into anything.~
@3506 = ~(sigh) Nothing is "wrong" <CHARNAME>, at least not with you. The problem lies with me. I'm sorry. I... I am having trouble in... reconciling myself. I get so confused! I love you, and so I want to protect you, to... keep you safe.~
@3507 = ~I will admit, it is the same way I felt about Keita. But I never wanted to be... intimate with Keita. I've never loved any of my playmates, <CHARNAME>, ever. Sex was at best a pleasant distraction, at worst an act forced upon me. In my mind, the physical and the emotional are so far divorced. I don't think I can ever resolve them.~
@3508 = ~I... I don't want you to be just another notch upon my bedpost, <CHARNAME>. You're too special to me.~
@3509 = ~Well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't surprised, Fade. I've never thought about this like that before. But I respect how you feel, and I shouldn't have tried it on. I'll wait until you are ready.~
@3510 = ~Fade, I'm sorry. I know you've had a difficult time with men in the past, and I should have been a little more sensitive, but let's just say that the "big" head wasn't doing all the thinking.~
@3511 = ~But Fade, I wouldn't have thought this would have bothered you! I mean, it's not like you haven't been round the block a few times already.~
@3512 = ~Kind of. I *do* want you, <CHARNAME>, it's just that... I... I am having trouble in... reconciling myself. I get so confused! I love you, and so I want to protect you, to...keep you safe.~
@3513 = ~Ironically, if you had approached me before my feelings had grown, I wouldn't have had a problem, quite the opposite. Now, however, I... I don't want you to be just another notch upon my bedpost, <CHARNAME>. You're too special to me.~
@3514 = ~It's okay, <CHARNAME>. It's only natural. The problem lies with me. I'm the one who should be sorry. I... I am having trouble in... reconciling myself. I get so confused! I love you, and so I want to protect you, to... keep you safe.~
@3515 = ~When... when we are going to be intimate. And there lies the problem. I... I am having trouble in... reconciling myself. I get so confused! I love you, and so I want to protect you, to... keep you safe.~
@3516 = ~Fade, I'm sorry. I know you've had a difficult time with men in the past, and I should have been a little more...sensitive.~
@3517 = ~I don't think you'd have to "push" me into anything, <CHARNAME>. I'm not unwilling, just confused. I love you, and so I want to protect you, to... keep you safe.~
@3518 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. (She leans into you again and hugs you close) I love you. You're so much more than I deserve.~
@3519 = ~(She chuckles and shakes her head) That's okay... and thank you. (She leans into you again and hugs you close) I love you. You're so much more than I deserve.~
@3520 = ~And so what? That I don't have the right to be sure that I want to sleep with you? Once a whore, always a whore?~
@3521 = ~No! No, that's not what I meant! I'm sorry. I know you've had a difficult time with men in the past, and I should be a little more sensitive, but let's just say that the "big" head isn't doing all the thinking at the moment.~
@3522 = ~That's not what I meant, Fade. I just wouldn't have thought this would have bothered you so much.~
@3523 = ~Well, you're always teasing me.~
@3524 = ~Well, it does. I want to be sure, <CHARNAME>. I love you... (sigh)... but I don't always understand you. No matter. I'll work it out.~
@3525 = ~I know I do. I suppose it's in my nature. To be honest, I don't mean anything by it. (grin) If it *did* mean anything, you would know! So what are you saying? That you want me to stop teasing you?~
@3526 = ~No, of course not. It's funny, although I'll admit I don't like it when you do it to other people! I want to keep you all to myself. (wrap her in a hug)~
@3527 = ~No, you know I don't. I love the way you tease me. But I'm sorry. I know you've had a difficult time with men in the past, and I should be a little more sensitive, but let's just say that the "big" head isn't doing all the thinking at the moment.~
@3528 = ~Well, unless you mean it, yes. It's not fair, to tease me and not come up with the goods.~
@3529 = ~(She hugs you back) That's alright. I want you to keep me all to yourself too. I love you... you're more than I deserve.~
@3530 = ~<CHARNAME>, I love you, you know that... (sigh)... but I don't always understand you. No matter. I'll work it out.~
@3531 = ~May I speak with you... privately, <CHARNAME>? (Her tail twitches slightly, and you cannot help but notice the rather blatantly hungry look she gives you)~
@3532 = ~Why?~
@3533 = ~If you've got something to tell me, tell me here and now, Fade.~
@3534 = ~(She winks and grins wolfishly at you) You'll see. (She fidgets slightly, as if she is uncomfortable)~
@3535 = ~No. If you've got something to tell me, tell me here and now.~
@3536 = ~(She stalks ahead of you, to a rather more secluded spot. When she stops, she turns around, her hands on her hips, her tail lashing wildly. As you wonder what it is you have done wrong this time, she pulls you close to her and kisses you hungrily. You begin to wonder if her lashing tail could be a signal of another tension entirely... )~
@3537 = ~(wrap your arms around her and kiss her back just as fiercely)~
@3538 = ~(hold her at arm's length) Whoa! I take it you've sorted out your little problem, then?~
@3539 = ~(disentangle yourself from her) Okay, I think I know what this is all about, and I'm not really interested, all right?~
@3540 = ~(She raises a crimson eyebrow and grins wolfishly) Here? I don't think you'd want an audience... unless that's the kind of thing you're really into. Come on! (She grabs you by the front of your tunic and drags you off behind her)~
@3541 = ~(She pulls away from your kiss, breathing heavily, and runs her tongue along her teeth) I think you know why I've brought you here, <CHARNAME>. (Her voice has a rough, husky edge to it, and she runs a finger down the front of your tunic and across your chest. She leans in closer to whisper in your ear; her breath is sweet on your cheek)~
@3542 = ~I want you. I want to feel you near me, your skin next to mine. I want to taste you, to explore you, to feel you inside me.~
@3543 = ~(She begins to unlace your tunic so she can feel your bare flesh under her fingers) I want to hear you scream, <CHARNAME>. I want to worship you.~
@3544 = ~(say nothing and let her continue)~
@3545 = ~(whisper) I... I haven't done this before, Fade. I don't know what you want me to do... ~
@3546 = ~(pull away from her) No, Fade. I know I said I loved you, but I've been having second thoughts. This isn't a good idea. I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to do this. Not with you.~
@3547 = ~I suppose you could say that... ~
@3548 = ~(She pulls you closer again, breathing heavily, and runs her tongue along her teeth) You know why I've brought you here, <CHARNAME>. (Her voice has a rough, husky edge to it, and she runs a finger down the front of your tunic and across your chest. She leans in closer to whisper in your ear; her breath is sweet on your cheek)~
@3549 = ~You're... not interested? I want you, here, <CHARNAME>... now. After what we spoke of last time... do... do you not love me anymore?~
@3550 = ~It's actually what you said that got me thinking, Fade. I do love you, I'm just not ready to love you like that yet. Too much is going on. I'm sorry.~
@3551 = ~I've been thinking much on that, Fade, and no, I don't. It's really the idea of loving you that I fell in love with--you're so unusual. I'm sorry.~
@3552 = ~(smile) I'll take that as a yes, then... ~
@3553 = ~(She guides you to the ground, and then stands over you. Slowly, almost teasingly, she removes her clothes, until she is clad in nothing more than her tattoos. She is lightly muscled, and again you notice that she is rather more curvaceous than other elves you have met)~
@3554 = ~(She runs her hands down the side of her body, and quirks a single eyebrow at you) Well, what do you think? Do I meet with your... approval?~
@3555 = ~(Actions speak louder than words, so, without bothering to reply, you simply reach up and pull her down beside you. Fade smiles rather wickedly, crimson eyes dancing) So eager, <CHARNAME>? Then let us begin... ~
@3556 = ~Truly? Well... I'll have to be gentle and teach you then, won't I?~
@3557 = ~(She pulls you close to her and kisses you softly, softer than you would imagine Fade capable of. She then guides you to the ground, and then stands over you. Slowly, almost teasingly, she removes her clothes, until she is clad in nothing more than her tattoos. She is lightly muscled, and again you notice that she is rather more curvaceous than other elves you have met)~
@3558 = ~(She tries to smile back, but her disappointment is plain. She sighs and nods in assent, and then lets you go)~
@3559 = ~Unusual? You thought me unusual, nothing more? So once again I am destined to be an oddity, an exotic, there for the pleasure of all? I'm glad you told me this, <CHARNAME>, for now I see you are no different from everyone else who has tried to use me! And I will NOT be used again!~
@3560 = ~(She glares at you, her eyes flashing wildly, and then storms off. After a few steps, she stops)~
@3561 = ~Oh, and, <CHARNAME>, with an attitude like that, you'd better get pretty friendly with your hands... unless you have gold to spare, of course!~
@3562 = ~So, you're awake. (She smiles contentedly, nestles herself against your shoulder, and traces a finger down your chest)~
@3563 = ~(hold her close and just enjoy the moment)~
@3564 = ~So, how do you feel?~
@3565 = ~(grin) I most certainly am.~
@3566 = ~(After a while, Fade sighs and rolls onto her back) I have to say this, <CHARNAME>, being with you is definitely... different. It was... I don't know, somehow less selfish than I'm used to.~
@3567 = ~What do you mean by that? If you prefer selfish, I can always do that.~
@3568 = ~Fade, it isn't supposed to be selfish. It's supposed to be an expression of our feelings for each other. I hope you realize that.~
@3569 = ~That's because this is love, Fade, not some casual fling. I want to please you, to show you how much I love you, not just gratify myself.~
@3570 = ~(She sighs and rolls onto her back) Feel? I feel... very contented, <CHARNAME>. Being with you is definitely... different. It was... I don't know, somehow less selfish than I'm used to.~
@3571 = ~(grin) I can see that, <CHARNAME>. (She sighs and rolls onto her back) I have to say this, <CHARNAME>, being with you is definitely... different. It was... I don't know, somehow less selfish than I'm used to.~
@3572 = ~No, that's not what I meant at all. I mean... I prefer it this way. I prefer it with you. It didn't feel like merely, well, scratching an itch, it meant something to me. And although I will admit that thought makes me feel a little vulnerable, I... I just never knew that's what it was supposed to be like.~
@3573 = ~It made you feel vulnerable? I suppose it can do that. That's because this is love, Fade, not some casual fling. I want to please you, to show you how much I love you, not just gratify myself.~
@3574 = ~(grin) So, do you want to start over again, before the others wake up?~
@3575 = ~I do now, <CHARNAME>. I suppose I was just worried that... that this would be just another thing you would do to me, and then that would be it--thank you, here's a few coppers for your time. I know that's a dreadful thing to think, but it's what I'm used to.~
@3576 = ~But now I know different. I prefer it this way. I prefer it with you. It didn't feel like merely, well, scratching an itch, it meant something to me. And although I will admit that thought makes me feel a little vulnerable, I... I just never knew that's what it was supposed to be like.~
@3577 = ~Well, I certainly feel loved! (Her smile turns a little crafty) Although there's nothing *wrong* with gratification, per se... ~
@3578 = ~You aren't wrong there. So, do you want to start over again, before the others wake up?~
@3579 = ~You minx! Come on, as much as I'd like to lie here all day, we really should get up now.~
@3580 = ~(grin) I thought you'd never ask... ~
@3581 = ~(She props herself up beside you and traces a finger along your jaw) Getting up already? Sure I can't... change your mind?~
@3582 = ~Not that I'm not tempted, but we do have much to do. We have to go.~
@3583 = ~Ooh, you little temptress... (pull her closer to you)~
@3584 = ~Yes, you're right. (grin) But later on, you're all mine, okay?~
@3585 = ~(grin) I try my best, <CHARNAME>... ~
@3586 = ~Can I ask you a silly question, <CHARNAME>?~
@3587 = ~Of course you can, my sweet. What is it?~
@3588 = ~(smile) That depends on just how silly it is, doesn't it?~
@3589 = ~Oh, Fade, not again. No, I don't know the one about the cleric, the rhinoceros and the vampire, nor do I know why clouds sometimes look like things, neither do I know why some people have, as you put it the other day, "funny looking heads"!~
@3590 = ~I just wanted to know... well... why did you agree to take me with you? You could easily have declined mine and Aran's offer. but you didn't.~
@3591 = ~I don't know. Seemed like a good idea at the time, I suppose.~
@3592 = ~Because you seemed so sincere in wanting to help me. I was wary of your intentions at first, but I've learnt to trust my instincts, and they were telling me to take you along.~
@3593 = ~Fade, why does it matter? All that matters is that I did take you, and I'm infinitely glad I did.~
@3594 = ~(grin) I thought you looked rather fine in all that black leather.~
@3595 = ~It's not too silly. I just wanted to know... well... why did you agree to take me with you? You could easily have declined mine and Aran's offer, but you didn't.~
@3596 = ~No! It's nothing like that... and what do you mean by that, anyway?!~
@3597 = ~Nothing. It's just that you can be a bit... random in what you talk about sometimes, that's all. So what did you want to know?~
@3598 = ~Well, you've got to admit it, Fade. You do talk utter nonsense sometimes!~
@3599 = ~I mean, unless it's important, don't bug me with it, okay?~
@3600 = ~Oh. That's all? Well... I suppose it's as good a reason as any.~
@3601 = ~What did you expect? I guessed you would be competent, and so I thought you could be useful. But that's all changed now.~
@3602 = ~Well, that and the fact that I thought you looked rather fine in all that black leather.~
@3603 = ~I admit, there were no thunderbolts when I first saw you. I was more worried that you might be a spy.. I had a job to do, and you offered to help me. That's it, I'm afraid.~
@3604 = ~Fade, when I first saw you, I thought you were the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. I was acutely aware that you were working for Aran, and I thought you were possibly his spy, but still I let you join us. And I'm glad I did.~
@3605 = ~Yes, I was very sincere. That surprised a few people. I had a bit of a reputation for being an "act first--think later" kind of person, but as soon as I found out what had happened, I knew I just had to help you. I'm glad I did.~
@3606 = ~As am I. I guessed you would be competent, and so I thought you could be useful. But that's all changed now.~
@3607 = ~(grin) Well, there was also the issue that I thought you looked mighty fine in all that black leather.~
@3608 = ~I thought I'd never admit this to anyone, much less you, but when I first saw you, I thought you were the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. I was acutely aware that you were working for Aran, and I thought you were possibly his spy, but still I let you join us. And I'm glad I did, too.~
@3609 = ~It matters because... well... I never intended any of this to happen. I joined you because I thought I could help you. But the more I think about it, the more it makes me wonder. You didn't have to take me along. You could have left me there, but you didn't.~
@3610 = ~What told you to take me along? What would have happened to me if you hadn't? Was it preordained? A fated meeting? Or merely a coincidence?~
@3611 = ~I believe we were fated to meet. I went with my instinct--I guessed you would be competent, but there was something else. I don't know what it was, but I just knew you had to come with me. And I'm glad you did.~
@3612 = ~It's just a coincidence, Fade. A happy one, but a coincidence, nothing more. I took you along because I thought you might be useful. Never did I think we would become this close. But we have, and that's what is important.~
@3613 = ~(grin) <CHARNAME>, I was trying to be serious!~
@3614 = ~I am being serious! When I first saw you, I thought you were the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. I was acutely aware that you were working for Aran, and I thought you were possibly his spy, but still I let you join us. And I'm glad I did, too.~
@3615 = ~(grin) Oh, come on, what was I supposed to do? A young lady, all clad in leather, offers me her services... I'm an impressionable young man, and that kind of thing *really* impresses me!~
@3616 = ~Nonsense?! I make informed and, ummm, knowledgeable remarks about my surroundings! (chuckle) Okay, I know I waffle on about rubbish sometimes, it's something that used to happen a lot in the Guild to pass the time when we were bored.~
@3617 = ~But this time I'm serious. Why did you agree to take me with you? You could easily have declined mine and Aran's s offer, but you didn't.~
@3618 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, please don't be like that. This is important to me. I know that's not the same as important to the group, but there is something I would really like to ask you.~
@3619 = ~Yes, it has, hasn't it? You know, I never intended any of this to happen. I knew I wanted to help you--what happened to Imoen really struck a chord in me. I've been helping to try to stamp out the slave trade in Athkatla, but it's like trying to hold back the sea. As soon as we think we've stopped one route, another one pops up almost immediately.~
@3620 = ~I thought in helping you to rescue Imoen, another one so wrongfully incarcerated would be freed. I never once thought that the man I agreed to help would become so dear to me.~
@3621 = ~You've been helping the slaves escape? I bet Aran doesn't like that.~
@3622 = ~I will admit that when I first met you, I was very wary of you. But as I got to know you, I suppose it was inevitable that you would become dear to me too.~
@3623 = ~So, what did you think of me when we first met?~
@3624 = ~Not the answer I wanted to hear, but an honest one, and I thank you for that. I will admit, I never intended for any of this to happen either. I knew I wanted to help you--what happened to Imoen really struck a chord in me. I've been helping to try to stamp out the slave trade in Athkatla, but it's like trying to hold back the sea. As soon as we think we've stopped one route, another one pops up almost immediately.~
@3625 = ~(blush) Really? I... I never realized that. I thought I was just a burden to you.~
@3626 = ~You were never a burden to me. So, what did you think of me when we first met?~
@3627 = ~Why are you blushing? Hasn't anyone ever told you that you're beautiful before?~
@3628 = ~(grin) Oh, come on, what was I supposed to think? A young lady, all clad in leather, offers me her services... I'm an impressionable young man, and that kind of thing *really* impresses me!~
@3629 = ~Something told you? Well, I don't know what that would have been. I'm not big on Gods, nor fate. After everything that has happened to me, it seems absurd to put it down to either.~
@3630 = ~All I knew is that I wanted to help you--what happened to Imoen really struck a chord in me. I've been helping to try to stamp out the slave trade in Athkatla, but it's like trying to hold back the sea. As soon as we think we've stopped one route, another one pops up almost immediately.~
@3631 = ~Yes, it is, isn't it? You know, I never intended any of this to happen. I knew I wanted to help you--what happened to Imoen really struck a chord in me. I've been helping to try to stamp out the slave trade in Athkatla, but it's like trying to hold back the sea. As soon as we think we've stopped one route, another one pops up almost immediately.~
@3632 = ~(laugh) Oh, <CHARNAME>! If that's how you view women in black leather, you must have been is some kind of heaven in the Guild!~
@3633 = ~No, not really. You were the only one who affected me that way. Hasn't anyone ever told you that you're beautiful before?~
@3634 = ~Ahhh, I'm joking. I will admit that when I first met you, I was very wary of you. But as I got to know you, I suppose it was inevitable that you would become dear to me.~
@3635 = ~I suppose. What did you think of me when we first met?~
@3636 = ~Aran? He... doesn't know. At least I don't think he knows. He's never pulled me up for it. It's something I do when I get time to myself. I can't just sit there and watch people being used like that--I had to do something. Hence the reason I had to help you.~
@3637 = ~That's almost noble of you, Fade.~
@3638 = ~I see. So, what did you think of me when we first met?~
@3639 = ~Do you know the first thing that struck me about you? How... normal you are. I knew from the outset that you were a Bhaalspawn, and so I think I expected you to be... I don't know, a little larger-than-life, I suppose. But you're not.~
@3640 = ~And is that a bad thing?~
@3641 = ~I see. Were you disappointed?~
@3642 = ~I wasn't brought up to be a Bhaalspawn. I was brought up to be a normal person. A lot of people seem to expect me to be some kind of supernatural force, but I'm not.~
@3643 = ~The first thing that struck me about you was how... normal you were. I knew from the outset that you were a Bhaalspawn, and so I think I expected you to be... I don't know, a little larger-than-life, I suppose. But you're not.~
@3644 = ~No one who has ever counted, no. I hold no illusions about my... differences.~
@3645 = ~Your "differences", as you put them, are part of your charm, Fade. So, how about me? What did you think of me when we first met?~
@3646 = ~Okay, your "differences" did kind of trouble me for a while, but not now. I love you--all of you. So, how about me? What did you think of me when we first met?~
@3647 = ~Noble? Not really. Big paladins running around in shiny armour are noble, not larcenous petty thieves with a weakness for shiny things. I help because I don't like it--and I try to change things I don't like!~
@3648 = ~So, did you try to change me, then?~
@3649 = ~Okay, point taken. Well, I've spilled the beans--what about you? What did you think of me when we first met?~
@3650 = ~No, it isn't. I was expecting to be completely overwhelmed by you. Well, I suppose I was, in a way, just not in the way I was expecting.~
@3651 = ~You were? How?~
@3652 = ~The feeling is mutual. Once you'd been with us for a while, I didn't know what had hit me.~
@3653 = ~No, not at all. I... liked the fact that you were normal. I soon found myself being attracted to your strength--not your physical strength, but the way you seem to cope with things. You're so, well, dependable. I found that almost comforting.~
@3654 = ~Then you rescued me from Mallon. I knew then I was lost to you. I think I've been yours a lot longer than you realise... and possibly longer than I would care to admit.~
@3655 = ~And I for one am glad that you're not. I... liked the fact that you were normal. I soon found myself being attracted to your strength--not your physical strength, but the way you seem to cope with things. You're so, well, dependable. I found that almost comforting.~
@3656 = ~No, I didn't. I said I only like to change things I *don't* like... and I liked you from the outset. You are so strong--I don't mean your physical strength, but the way you cope with things. You're so, well, dependable. I found that almost comforting.~
@3657 = ~I... liked the fact that you were normal. What overwhelmed me was your strength--not your physical strength, but the way you seem to cope with things. I was overwhelmed by my own feelings for you.~
@3658 = ~(chuckle) If only we had been more honest with our feelings--it would have saved a lot of heartache and agonizing on my part, I can tell you! But I was overwhelmed by my feelings for you. You are so strong--I don't mean your physical strength, but the way you cope with things. You're so, well, dependable. I found that almost comforting.~
@3659 = ~(The party has stopped for a short break and you sit for awhile around the fire discussing the day's events so far and what the future may hold. Slowly the others drift off to collect their things, leaving you and Fade alone)~
@3660 = ~(Though she participated in the discussions there has been a darkness about her that even the light of the fire could not push back. Even now she gazes into the fire with a solemn and troubled look, lost in her own thoughts)~
@3661 = ~Fade, what is it? What has you so troubled?~
@3662 = ~You wear the darkness about you like a cloak. Take it off for a bit, you're safe.~
@3663 = ~Keep that look much longer and it'll freeze on your face, and we wouldn't want that.~
@3664 = ~It's nothing really, <CHARNAME>. Just thinking.~
@3665 = ~I know you better than that. It isn't "nothing". Please, you know you can tell me.~
@3666 = ~Something is weighing heavily on you, honeykitten, I can tell. It might help to talk about it.~
@3667 = ~Okay. Don't say I didn't ask. Come on, we have to go.~
@3668 = ~Am I, <CHARNAME>? I'm not so sure.~
@3669 = ~What do you mean?~
@3670 = ~Of course you're safe. You're surrounded by friends and we've dealt with the slavers, if that's what you're worried about.~
@3671 = ~(wrap her in your arms but say nothing)~
@3672 = ~What? I'm sorry. I wasn't really concentrating. I was thinking of... other things.~
@3673 = ~I didn't mean to add to your troubles.~
@3674 = ~Other things? What other things?~
@3675 = ~Now that I've pulled your attention from the fire, what's wrong?~
@3676 = ~(sigh) Since we last spoke, I have been thinking about... my past, and I'm worried we haven't seen the last of the Pasha. There is no way he would give up this easily.~
@3677 = ~I bought your contract. He has no legal right to you anymore.~
@3678 = ~His men are dead. A rational man would cut his losses.~
@3679 = ~(gather her into a warm embrace) It's been on my mind too.~
@3680 = ~(groan) Why do you call me that? Okay, you're just trying to cheer me up. (smile) Thank you. I have just been thinking about... my past recently--I'm just worried we haven't seen the last of the Pasha. There is no way he would give up this easily.~
@3681 = ~Wait, please. I... I have to speak to you.~
@3682 = ~I mean I've been thinking about my past a lot recently, and I'm not sure we've seen the last of the Pasha. I'm not convinced and... it scares me.~
@3683 = ~We killed those he sent after you. That should send a message. A rational person would cut his losses.~
@3684 = ~He has no legal claim on you anymore, Fade. You've destroyed the contract. What can he do?~
@3685 = ~I'm not so sure, <CHARNAME>. The Pasha won't give up so easily. He believes I've made a fool of him, and he suffers such from no one.~
@3686 = ~(gather her into a warm embrace) I've thought as much, but hoped I was wrong.~
@3687 = ~(Her tail snakes up between you to wrap itself around an arm. She makes small sounds of contentment as she eases back against your chest) Really? I... I don't want this to be your problem <CHARNAME>. It's something I have to deal with--you've got enough going on to worry about as it is.~
@3688 = ~Fade, your problems *are* my problems. That's what being together is all about. If it happens, and I sincerely hope it doesn't... well, we'll sort it out. The Pasha has no claim to you, and I won't let him take you.~
@3689 = ~Please, stop worrying what *might* happen. We may all get eaten by a dragon tomorrow--we don't know! There's really no point in letting it eat at you like this.~
@3690 = ~What worries me more is that you are unhappy. (Kiss her neck) What would it take to make you happy again?~
@3691 = ~You could never do that <CHARNAME>--never. If anyone is adding to troubles it'll probably be me.~
@3692 = ~You're worried about the Pasha aren't you? We've dealt with his men, Fade. You'll be alright.~
@3693 = ~(gather her into a warm embrace) Your troubles are my troubles Fade. I'd have it no other way.~
@3694 = ~But I do worry. There's no guarantee Mallon will give the gold to the Pasha or that the contract he gave you is even valid. It looked real enough, but it could have been a fake. I just don't think he'd give up so easily.~
@3695 = ~We beat him once, we could do it again.~
@3696 = ~I won't let him take you again, Fade. I promise you that.~
@3697 = ~In case you missed it in my previous discussions with you, the Pasha is *not* a rational man. He thinks I've made a fool of him and now, so have you. I doubt he'll simply suffer such insults.~
@3698 = ~I really don't think it will be up to you, <CHARNAME>. If he decides to come after me again, there will be no choice.~
@3699 = ~I can't help it. If he decides to come after me again, there will be no choice in the matter, believe me.~
@3700 = ~(smile) You do know how to take a girl's mind off her troubles, I'll you give that.~
@3701 = ~(tilt her head gently upwards) Oh? You think this is distracting?~
@3702 = ~The future will bring what it will. I'd much rather enjoy the here and now.~
@3703 = ~(hug her to you and nuzzle her cheek) I'm at your command.~
@3704 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. It's just... ~
@3705 = ~(silence her with a kiss)~
@3706 = ~I believe you, <CHARNAME>. It's just... ~
@3707 = ~(You lower your lips to hers gently at first, but this soon gives way to a hungry probing. You feel her tail constricting around you as she reaches up to pull your head closer to hers)~
@3708 = ~(When you finally break free, it is obvious you have distracted Fade from her melancholy thoughts. She looks at you with eyes alight with desire and there is tightness low in your body)~
@3709 = ~You've really got to stop doing that to me, <CHARNAME>, but I take your point. Stop worrying about the past, and fearing the future.~
@3710 = ~(grin) In fact... I think I'm rather looking forward to our immediate future. (She pulls you closer to her and kisses you again)~
@3711 = ~Yes, sometimes that sentiment is appropriate. (grins) Although what *you* undoubtedly have on your mind will have to wait until later! I think we have to get going now, or we won't be popular!~
@3712 = ~Oh, really? (She turns to face you a wicked smile on her face) Well, let's just see how well you take orders later on... ~
@3713 = ~I... I couldn't bear it if you were injured because of me. I just couldn't... .~
@3714 = ~And I couldn't bear to have you taken away from me. I am a Child of Bhaal and if need be I will remind the Pasha of that, even if I have to bring his palace down around him to do it.~
@3715 = ~No more than I could bear to have you taken from me. Enough of this, we both have enough bad memories--let us make some good ones.~
@3716 = ~(sigh) Hearing you say that... that you'd come for me, no matter what... it makes me feel truly safe for the first time I can remember. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@3717 = ~(grin) My thoughts exactly! Although maybe later, huh? I think we have to get going now, or we won't be popular!~
@3718 = ~You know, it's funny how things have worked out. I sometimes wonder how things would have turned out if Keita had escaped... if she were still alive.~
@3719 = ~You really miss her, don't you?~
@3720 = ~Fade, you really have to stop torturing yourself over what happened to Keita.~
@3721 = ~I've wondered that myself. Would we have even met? I doubt it.~
@3722 = ~Yes, I do. She deserved to escape more that I did. She endured much, much more than me for much, much longer. It... it doesn't seem fair that I am here, enjoying myself, while she is dead.~
@3723 = ~You really have to stop torturing yourself this, Fade. Like I have said before, it wasn't your fault.~
@3724 = ~Unfortunately, these things happen. All you can do now is look to the future, and on what we have.~
@3725 = ~What are you saying? That you'd rather she was alive and that we had never met?~
@3726 = ~Fade, please, I don't want to keep going over this. It happened, and there was nothing you could do.~
@3727 = ~I... I can't help it, <CHARNAME>. I know I did everything in my power to keep her safe, but she still died. I look at myself now and wonder how different I would be as a person if she had survived.~
@3728 = ~Yes, I doubt it too. I expect Keita and I would have traveled further north, to Luskan, or to Waterdeep. I certainly wouldn't have become a Shadow Thief. We talked about it a lot--traveling around, helping people in the same situation as us. If only... if only she hadn't died on me.~
@3729 = ~So what you're basically saying is I should just get over it? Just forget her and concentrate solely on you? Act like she had never existed... like she never mattered?~
@3730 = ~Fade, I didn't mean it like that, and you know it!~
@3731 = ~Stop being so defensive! All I am saying is you can't keep dwelling on the past all the time.~
@3732 = ~No, of course not! Her memory should be honoured, but not to the expense of your future happiness.~
@3733 = ~Of course I would rather she was alive! I mean... of course I'm glad we've met and everything, but at the expense of someone's life? I... I can't help it <CHARNAME>, but sometimes I feel very guilty.~
@3734 = ~You can't keep focusing on the past like this. What happened, *happened*. Don't let it ruin what we have.~
@3735 = ~Don't be defensive, Fade--you know what I mean!~
@3736 = ~Keita wouldn't have wanted you to feel guilty about being happy, Fade. It's right to remember her, but not at the expense of your future happiness!~
@3737 = ~Oh, so I'm boring you now? Well, I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>! Would you prefer it if I just forgot her altogether then, and concentrated solely on you?~
@3738 = ~Do I? You're asking me to basically dismiss one of the most important people in my life. Alive or dead, Keita meant everything to me! I thought you at least would understand that.~
@3739 = ~Of course I understand that! I feel exactly the same way about Imoen.~
@3740 = ~Of course I understand! Her memory should be honoured, but not at the expense on your future happiness.~
@3741 = ~I'm NOT being defensive! I don't see that there is anything wrong with remembering you loved ones and feeling bad about the fact that they are *dead*.~
@3742 = ~And I'm not saying that there *is* anything wrong with remembering the dead! All I am saying is that you shouldn't sacrifice your future happiness by focusing on it all the time!~
@3743 = ~Please, stop dwelling on the past all the time. What happened, *happened*. Don't let it ruin what we have.~
@3744 = ~Maybe you forget, but I too have lost loved ones... many of us here have. And although we remember them every day of our lives, we don't let their memory get to us in the way that the memory of Keita gets to you!~
@3745 = ~<CHARNAME>, Keita is part of who I am! Without her, I certainly wouldn't be here today--and I don't think you understand that!~
@3746 = ~I do understand, Fade. I just don't want it to ruin what we have!~
@3747 = ~Always thinking of yourself, huh, <CHARNAME>? I... I've had enough of talking to you now. I need some time to myself to remember my dead friend.~
@3748 = ~Yes, but at least there's a good chance Imoen is still alive! There is still a good chance everything will be okay for the two of you. Not so for Keita and me!~
@3749 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I think I need some time to myself now. Whether you like it or not, I need to think about my very *dead* friend.~
@3750 = ~But Imoen is alive! You *did* manage to rescue her--I never had the luxury!~
@3751 = ~Well, maybe I can't cope with these things as well as you can! I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I think I need some time to myself now. Whether you like it or not, I need to think about my very *dead* friend.~
@3752 = ~(She catches your arm and entwines her fingers around yours) Hi.~
@3753 = ~Hey, how are you? Have you calmed down now?~
@3754 = ~Fade, I never meant to upset you over Keita. I suppose I didn't realise everything is still so raw for you.~
@3755 = ~What do you want?~
@3756 = ~Yes. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I realise now what you were trying to say to me, but I was in such a bleak mood... I shouldn't have taken it out on you.~
@3757 = ~You don't have to apologise. I'm just thankful you realise I wasn't trying to upset you.~
@3758 = ~I'm sorry too. I suppose I thought that after all this time, things wouldn't still be so raw for you. I didn't mean to upset you.~
@3759 = ~All I want is for you to be happy, Fade. I don't want you to forget Keita, just to stop punishing yourself over what happened.~
@3760 = ~I know you didn't. I just get a little... oversensitive about things occasionally, and I'm sorry. I really shouldn't take it out on you.~
@3761 = ~It's okay. I'm just thankful you realise I wasn't trying to upset you.~
@3762 = ~(smile) I suppose we inevitably hit out against those we are dearest to. I don't blame you.~
@3763 = ~(sigh) I suppose I deserve as much. I... I just want to say I'm sorry--again. I realise now what you were trying to say to me, and you're right. I shouldn't let Keita's death get to me so much. And I certainly shouldn't have taken it out on you. I'm sorry.~
@3764 = ~I know. And you're right, I do need to let go--to remember Keita as she was in life, not in death. She wouldn't want me to be dwelling on this. She would be pleased that I'm so happy with you. I... shouldn't feel guilty.~
@3765 = ~Letting go doesn't mean you have to forget her. Treasure her memory--don't use it as a weapon against yourself!~
@3766 = ~And I'm pleased you have realized that at last. You are allowed a little bit of happiness in your life!~
@3767 = ~What brought this about, anyway? Are you still concerned about the Pasha?~
@3768 = ~I'll try, <CHARNAME>. I realise now that all of this negativity does her memory no favours--it won't bring her back. I should be thankful for what I have now... and be thankful that I did at least have the chance to know her, even if it was cut short so cruelly.~
@3769 = ~I know nothing I can say will take away the pain of your loss, even after all these years, but please know that I am here for you. Treasure her memory--don't use it as a weapon against yourself!~
@3770 = ~Be thankful, but don't feel guilty about allowing yourself a little bit of happiness in your life. If Keita cared for you half as much as you obviously cared for her, she would never begrudge you that.~
@3771 = ~Yes, I suppose we do. You know, I actually blamed Keita for what happened for months afterwards? I thought her... selfish for leaving me. Then I realized I was being the selfish one, and that hurt.~
@3772 = ~Now I understand. I do need to let go and remember Keita as she was in life, not in death. She wouldn't want me to be dwelling on this. She would be pleased that I'm so happy with you. I... shouldn't feel guilty.~
@3773 = ~Fade, the way you felt after Keita's death was totally normal. I felt exactly the same after Gorion died. I still feel that way sometimes, but that's only natural. I would be a lot more concerned if it didn't bother you.~
@3774 = ~I'll try, <CHARNAME>, I really will. Thank you for understanding.~
@3775 = ~(smile) I think you qualify as a little more than just a *little* bit of happiness, <CHARNAME>.~
@3776 = ~Yes, I am. And in thinking about him, I inevitably started thinking about Keita. If anyone is to blame, it's that bastard.~
@3777 = ~Please, don't think about him. You're safe now, and entitled to a little bit of happiness as much as the next person.~
@3778 = ~And if I *ever* get to meet that bastard... ~
@3779 = ~You... you felt the same way after Gorion's death? I didn't know that. I thought it may have been because I am Fey'ri. We're not known for our compassion, but if that's not the case... thank you, <CHARNAME>. That is a great comfort to me.~
@3780 = ~I hope you never do. I can't risk losing someone else I love to him.~
@3781 = ~I know I've asked you something like this before, <CHARNAME>, but do you ever think of the future?~
@3782 = ~Of course I do. I'm always thinking about what is going to happen next.~
@3783 = ~Not much. So much has happened to me recently, I haven't given it a lot of thought.~
@3784 = ~Well... after all this. After you've sorted Irenicus out. What then?~
@3785 = ~Oh, that. No, I haven't given it much thought, to be honest with you.~
@3786 = ~I'm not entirely sure. It would be nice to leave the adventuring life behind, though... ~
@3787 = ~I expect I'll carry on seeking adventure. I can't ever see myself settling down.~
@3788 = ~So... what then? What do you see?~
@3789 = ~It would be nice to settle down, I suppose, leave the adventuring life behind. I quite fancy a little farm somewhere.~
@3790 = ~I'd like to think I'd still be adventuring. I can't ever see myself settling down.~
@3791 = ~I can understand that sentiment. I suppose with everything you've been through, *not* living on a purely day-to-day basis would seem pretty strange.~
@3792 = ~What are you suggesting, then? That you do our thinking for us? What do you want for the future?~
@3793 = ~Exactly. Although I suppose settling down would be nice... ~
@3794 = ~Well, I can't ever see myself ever abandoning the adventuring life and settling down. I don't think I'd do that very well.~
@3795 = ~Really? You'd like to leave the adventuring life? That does kind of surprise me.~
@3796 = ~Why should it? I quite fancy getting myself a little farm somewhere.~
@3797 = ~(grin) So you'd expect me to still be adventuring when I'm old and grey, huh? No, I don't think so. By that time, I think I'd like to be settled, with a tribe of grandchildren to tell my tales to.~
@3798 = ~I thought you'd say that. But do you ever just wish you could... leave it all behind and just live a simpler, more settled life?~
@3799 = ~No, it would drive me insane! Could you imagine it? Waking in the same bed everyday, doing the same chores day in day out... it would be so boring!~
@3800 = ~Maybe later--just not right now. I'd like to see more of Faerun before I ever think of settling down.~
@3801 = ~(laugh) A farm? For some reason, I can't see you feeding chickens, <CHARNAME>.~
@3802 = ~Why not? It would be nice: the two of us, with a little place of our own. Unless that's not what you want.~
@3803 = ~Yes, I suppose it does stretch the imagination a bit. So what do you see for us, then?~
@3804 = ~(grin) Well, if you're going to laugh at me... what do *you* want for the future?~
@3805 = ~Me? I'm not really sure. That's why I asked you. I... I suppose I just wondered if I had a place in your future.~
@3806 = ~Of course you do! I can't imagine a future without you... unless that's not what you want.~
@3807 = ~Who knows what the future may bring? Let's just enjoy what we have now, and worry about what happens next when it happens!~
@3808 = ~Grandchildren? But for that you need children.~
@3809 = ~What's wrong, Fade? Don't you want kids?~
@3810 = ~Fade, I think you're jumping ahead of yourself here. Who knows what the future may bring? Let's just enjoy what we have now, and worry about what comes next when it happens.~
@3811 = ~(sigh) Yes, after all the excitement, settling down would seem boring. But even if you did continue to adventure... would you want me with you?~
@3812 = ~Of course I would! I can't imagine a future without you... unless that's not what you want.~
@3813 = ~Well, you already know I would agree with you on that. I'd love to see more of Faerun. With you. If that's what you want.~
@3814 = ~Of course that's what I want! I can't imagine a future without you... unless that's not what you want.~
@3815 = ~(You hold her close, and she returns your embrace, her head on your shoulder. You both stand for a long moment enjoying the closeness till Fade moves back enough to look at you)~
@3816 = ~That's what I want. Wherever I go or whatever I do, so long as you're with me, I know I'll be happy... and safe.~
@3817 = ~And you'll never be bored. (drop your hands to her hips and tickle her)~
@3818 = ~And loved. (kiss her)~
@3819 = ~(grin) What do I see? I'd like to think that I'd see us. Together. For a long, long time.~
@3820 = ~I'm glad we agree! It would be nice to settle down someday, with a tribe of grandchildren to tell our tales to.~
@3821 = ~Of course I do! As long as that's what you want too.~
@3822 = ~Oh. Well, I suppose you're right. Let us live life for the now. (She smiles and kisses you lightly, pulling you closer to her)~
@3823 = ~(She looks slightly embarrassed) Well... maybe, one day. Although I'm not too sure I'd make such a great mother.~
@3824 = ~(She then laughs and cups your chin with her hand) But I fear we are getting ahead of ourselves! I suppose I just wondered... if I had a place in your future, that's all.~
@3825 = ~(She makes a small sound of surprise that quickly gives way to laughter that fills the air) Oh no, not with you. *Never* will I be bored.~
@3826 = ~(She slaps your hand away) Come on. We've got a ways to go yet, and you can use the time to think of how you'll cure my... boredom tonight.~
@3827 = ~(Your lips find hers as your hand slides up into her hair. The kiss is long and soft, your tongues slowly caressing each other's lips. When you finally pull back you are both wearing contented smiles) Now how could I forget that?~
@3828 = ~(She takes your hand in hers and gives you a wink) Come on, we have a ways to go yet. Besides, I think I may have a memory lapse tonight, and you can use the time to think of how you'll... remind me I'm loved.~
@3829 = ~(She snakes an arm around your waist and grins at you. She then winks, and you feel her roving hand travel south, looking for gaps in your armour) I wonder what we have in here...~
@3830 = ~(grin) You know damn well what's in there. Pack it in!~
@3831 = ~(mock-growl) Minx.~
@3832 = ~Fade, what are you doing?!~
@3833 = ~Oi, stop that!~
@3834 = ~(She flutters her eyelashes at you playfully as her hand continues its roving) Oh come on, <CHARNAME>... where's your sense of adventure?~
@3835 = ~(whisper) I said pack it in!~
@3836 = ~Fade, not with everyone else around! We might get caught.~
@3837 = ~Adventure? So what are you suggesting? That we just get it on here and now, in front of everyone?~
@3838 = ~(snicker) So... what do you think? (She bites her bottom lip, looking up at you expectantly)~
@3839 = ~No... not here, not now. Later on, okay?~
@3840 = ~What? Right here, in front of everyone?~
@3841 = ~(grin) Isn't it obvious?~
@3842 = ~Yes, you little minx!~
@3843 = ~Come on, let's just stop for a bit. (Her grin widens*) I'll make it worth your while...~
@3844 = ~I said stop it and I mean stop it!~
@3845 = ~I know. (whisper) But that's what makes it all the more exciting...~
@3846 = ~Not for me it doesn't! Maybe later, when we're alone, okay?~
@3847 = ~Exciting? Really?~
@3848 = ~You really are a terrible influence on me, you know.~
@3849 = ~Of course not! We could just stop for a bit and find somewhere a little more secluded.~
@3850 = ~But we might still get caught!~
@3851 = ~(She looks slightly disappointed and rather frustrated) Alright... (grin) But you'd better have something quite spectacular in mind, okay?~
@3852 = ~(She moves her hand and hugs your arm) I'm sorry... I didn't mean to embarrass you.~
@3853 = ~(She nods, grinning wickedly) Now you just go and tell everyone we're taking a break, and I'll meet *you* over there. (She points to a secluded spot)~
@3854 = ~No problem!~
@3855 = ~Fade, I didn't mean that as an invitation. I can't do this here and now. Maybe later on, okay?~
@3856 = ~(She grins wickedly) I aim to please,  <CHARNAME>. Now you just go and tell everyone we're taking a break, and I'll meet *you* over there. (She points to a secluded spot)~
@3857 = ~(As you turn to leave, she grabs your arm and whispers in your ear) But don't take too long, or I may be... forced to start without you. (wink)~
@3858 = ~That is it. I'm free. No longer just someone's lackey... and I have you to thank for it all, <CHARNAME>! I... I thought I knew what happiness was before, but now I know it was all just an illusion, because this is true happiness. You are true happiness.~
@3859 = ~(say nothing, just hold her close to you)~
@3860 = ~(smile) You're making me blush.~
@3861 = ~No, I'm not true happiness. The knowledge that you are able to do what you want from now on is true happiness. Being true to yourself is real happiness. I'm just glad I was able to help you.~
@3862 = ~(She holds you tightly back, and you soon realise from the trembling in her shoulders that she is crying)~
@3863 = ~Fade, come now... why are you upset? This is a happy time, not crying time!~
@3864 = ~You don't need to cry, sweetheart. Everything has worked out fine.~
@3865 = ~Don't be so melodramatic, Fade. Come on, we're drawing a crowd! Let's just... you know... get on with what we have to do.~
@3866 = ~It's true, though. I joined up with you to achieve one goal, and you've allowed me to achieve so much more, more than I ever dreamed possible. I... I don't think there is anything I can do to ever repay you. I... you... it's just...~
@3867 = ~(She trails off, obviously lost for words)~
@3868 = ~Us being together is not a transaction, Fade! Think of all the things you've done for me in the past! And of the things you are bound to do for me... for us... in the future. I wouldn't have it any other way.~
@3869 = ~You're absolutely hopeless! I've done these things because I love you, not to gain something from you! We're a partnership, kid... and a bloody fine one too.~
@3870 = ~(laugh) Always so modest! But you know I speak the truth. I joined up with you to achieve one goal, and you've allowed me to achieve so much more, more than I ever dreamed possible. I... I don't think there is anything I can do to ever repay you. I... you... it's just...~
@3871 = ~I can't help it! And I'm not crying because I'm upset. I... I... just can't seem to help it!~
@3872 = ~I've heard of tears of joy, but this is ridiculous. Come on, honeykitten! Dry those eyes and look to the future with me.~
@3873 = ~Women! You're all crazy. I suppose that's why I love you, though!~
@3874 = ~I know it has. It's just all a bit overwhelming. You've turned my life upside down. I can't believe it's happened, that you've actually freed me from all this, that we're together, that I'm part of your life... I can't repay you for any of this, <CHARNAME>!~
@3875 = ~(She wipes her eyes with the back of her hand) Yes, I know... I'm sorry. It's all just a bit overwhelming. Let's just go and get your soul back. That's the important thing here.~
@3876 = ~I know you're right, <CHARNAME>. Compared to your problems, mine are completely trivial! At least I can be with you now, to help you get your soul back. Let's go and sort that Irenicus out once and for all!~
@3877 = ~(She grins despite herself) Indeed! Together we can only be stronger. Let's go and sort that Irenicus out once and for all!~
@3878 = ~(She grins despite herself and dries her eyes on the back of her hand) I'll try! Maybe once this is all over, we can find a nice deserted, secret little place we can call our own for a while... but until then, let's go and sort that Irenicus out once and for all!~
@3879 = ~(laugh) And I suppose you males make perfect sense all the time! But still... thank you. For everything. Now let's go and sort that Irenicus out once and for all!~
@3880 = ~(Fade narrows her eyes) Fine. (She plucks your fingers from her ear.) And I don't want *you* touching *me.* I think we're both perfectly clear on this.~
@3881 = ~Why, thank you, <CHARNAME>. It's good to see that at least *someone* has a sense of humour around here.~
@3882 = ~Whatever you want. I didn't think simpering little girls were your thing, but obviously I was wrong.~
@3883 = ~Now that's over, can I ask you something <CHARNAME>?~
@3884 = ~Fine, I'll leave you both to it. Just don't come crying to me when it all inevitably goes wrong.~
@3885 = ~Only... only that I have to apologise for how I spoke to you last. I lost my temper, and that was wrong.~
@3886 = ~Apologise? Not likely! Am I not allowed to ask you a simple question without running it past Little Miss Balance now? I didn't realize she was your keeper!~
@3887 = ~Not when you insult her, no! I will not tolerate it.~
@3888 = ~Of course she's not! I don't know where she gets the idea that she might be. What did you want to ask?~
@3889 = ~Fine. I only wanted to ask you a simple question, because no matter what *she* thinks, I am concerned about you. But I see you only value her opinion, so I shall take my leave.~
@3890 = ~(She looks over warily and shudders) Not a rat?~
@3891 = ~(smile) Not a rat. (put an arm around her shoulders)~
@3892 = ~(laugh) Never thought you'd be scared of rats, Fade. But no, Boo isn't a rat. (try to put an arm around her shoulder)~
@3893 = ~For the love of... what's wrong with you, woman? Boo's not a rat, difference being he's about half the size, he lacks the tail and he's a sodding hamster! Go on, look closer... ~
@3894 = ~(She runs away, obviously terrified)~
@3895 = ~(shake head) Oh dear, I'd better go after her... maybe you should try to introduce her to Boo another time, Minsc.~
@3896 = ~What in the Nine Hells was THAT all about? (sigh) Oh well, Minsc, maybe you should try to introduce the two of them at a later date... ~
@3897 = ~Ummm, all right... not a rat... (she shrinks back slightly against your chest) Err, nice Boo. No, Minsc, you keep hold of him, I wouldn't want to drop him or anything... ~
@3898 = ~(grin) Maybe it's time for you to put Boo away now, Minsc, for everyone's sake.~
@3899 = ~(She relaxes as Boo is put away, but does not shrug off your arm)~
@3900 = ~(Entwine a lock of her long crimson hair between your fingers) Are you all right now?~
@3901 = ~(She pulls away slightly) I'm fine, <CHARNAME>. (grin) But let me remind you, I'm not some kind of delicate flower who needs looking after, and I think I am perfectly capable of looking after myself.~
@3902 = ~(She disentangles herself from you) And I don't take too kindly to being treated as if I can't. (winks and walks away)~
@3903 = ~(Feeling a little confused, you watch her as she walks away. Has she just told you off, or was that some kind of invitation?)~
@3904 = ~(After walking a short way from you, she stops, turns and blows you a kiss with a cheeky grin on her face.~
@3905 = ~(She shrugs off your arm indignantly) I'm not afraid of rats! I was just... taken by surprise, that's all.~
@3906 = ~Nice Boo... good Boo. You stay with Minsc, like a good... rodent.~
@3907 = ~(Under your breath) Suuureee, Fade... Maybe it's time for you to put Boo away now, Minsc, for everyone's sake... ~
@3908 = ~I heard that. (crosses her arms and stalks off)~
@3909 = ~Oh, for the love of... Fade! I didn't mean it like that! (go after her)~
@3910 = ~Sensitive, isn't she, Minsc? Well, I suppose I'd better go after her... ~
@3911 = ~(She stops, but doesn't turn around, tapping her foot on the ground)~
@3912 = ~I'm sorry, Fade, I didn't mean to... ~
@3913 = ~(You trail off under her silence. Then, to your great surprise, she turns around, and with a playful grin, kisses you on the cheek.)~
@3914 = ~(whisper) So, who's the tease now? Two can play at that game, you know that... ~
@3915 = ~(She winks, and with a decidedly mischievous grin, saunters off again.)~
@3916 = ~Pardon? There's nothing wrong with me, <CHARNAME>, although I can't say the same for you if you continue to insult me so... (draws her weapon)~
@3917 = ~Fade! Calm down! I wasn't insulting you, I was just teasing you... put the sword down, and we'll say no more about the matter, okay?~
@3918 = ~Pack it in, Fade. I don't take kindly to being threatened. Minsc, I'd put Boo away if I were you. Especially as some people can't take a joke... ~
@3919 = ~(She raises an eyebrow, and after a moment, sheathes her sword) All right, <CHARNAME>. (turns and leaves)~
@3920 = ~(She grips her sword tightly) Pack it in? Can't take the joke? (she growls, her tail lashing)~
@3921 = ~(sigh) I'm not going to argue with you, Fade. Just stop it. Now.~
@3922 = ~Fine. If that's how you want it. (turns sharply and leaves)~
@3923 = ~(sigh) Again I see you staring gawk-eyed at <CHARNAME>, Fade. Please, close your mouth and take yourself elsewhere, lest I be washed away by your ill-disguised desires.~
@3924 = ~I am rapidly growing weary of your barbed and foul mouth, drow. Your constant jealousy leaves a bitter miasma, tainting everything it touches.~
@3925 = ~Jealousy? Hardly. What is there to be jealous of? I just find it hard to concentrate around such simpering. Surely you are a disgrace to your heritage, jalil. Are you hoping that <CHARNAME> will deign to indulge in your... animalistic charms?~
@3926 = ~Animalistic?~
@3927 = ~Why, yes, fiendling. Animals have tails, and any pairing with you would surely have to be considered an act of bestiality by--~
@3928 = ~You tread on dangerous ground there, darkling. I should hold your poisoned tongue, before I cut it out.~
@3929 = ~Hah! Do not threaten your betters, iblith! The drow summon and command your demonic counterparts as slaves, and we would do the same to your mongrel kind if you were worth the bother.~
@3930 = ~Again, I warn you, Viconia... ~
@3931 = ~Warn me of what? Your... base thuggery against the strength of my goddess-given magic? Shar stands with me, fiendling, and together we shall teach you your place in this world!~
@3932 = ~Oh yes, your goddess. And you have the nerve to speak to me of slavery? I forget that the drow are nothing without some half-cut, half-insane deity in tow to bolster themselves. You speak constantly of the strength of the drow, but it is an external thing, granted to you, not from within, in the blood, like the Fey'ri!~
@3933 = ~I should strike you where you stand for that blasphemy, iblith!~
@3934 = ~So why don't you? Come on, Viconia. You forever speak of your strength, of your cruelty, but I have yet to see either in any measurable quantity. Strike me if you dare? Or are you afraid of your own insignificance, that your... goddess... won't measure up?~
@3935 = ~Let me say it in your filthy tongue, so you know *exactly* what I mean:  Jous uns'aa t'yin, kl'eril uss--jous uns'aa vel'bol dos ph' morfel del! Show me then, useless one--show me what you are made of!~
@3936 = ~Losing control of that fiery temper, fiendling? Let me stoke that pathetic wrath of yours further! (She begins to move her hands and chant, obviously invoking her goddess to cast a spell.)~
@3937 = ~(Fade sees Viconia casting, and with a guttural growl, charges her. She cannons into Viconia, knocking the slighter drow to the floor, disrupting her spell. The drow tries to wrestle herself free from the slightly heavier Fey'ri, but instead earns herself a stinging back-hand across the face from the wildly enraged part-demoness.)~
@3938 = ~Let me go! You shall pay! I shall stove your head in! I shall turn your bones to lead! I shall... ~
@3939 = ~Shut up, Vil'khroch bitch!~
@3940 = ~(She grins fiercely as Viconia complies, though the drow priestess looks like she's about to set Fade on fire with just her wrathful gaze.) So, the 'supreme ruler' has fallen! It looks as though your goddess has failed you after all!~
@3941 = ~(Before Fade can do any more damage to Viconia, and before Viconia can take advantage of the Fey'ri's gloating to do her harm, you employ the most basic of prevention tactics: grab them both by the ear)~
@3942 = ~Ahhh! What's this for?~
@3943 = ~Unhand me, male!~
@3944 = ~(Both women, however, don't struggle too hard. It's amazing how much control a person has over you when they've got you by the ear.)~
@3945 = ~All right, ladies. Break it up. As arousing as a catfight is, I need both of you in one piece.~
@3946 = ~Fade, what the hell do you think you're doing? Viconia was obviously baiting you. I thought you'd know better than to play into her hands.~
@3947 = ~Viconia, why do you insist on harassing Fade?~
@3948 = ~Hmmph. She started it. I don't understand why you drag the useless drow bitch around with us.~
@3949 = ~Speak for yourself, fiendling. It's not as though you contribute anything to this party but your whoring, slithering body for all to look at.~
@3950 = ~Enough! Fade, if I ever see you touch Viconia again, I swear I'll... I don't know, but it will be unpleasant!~
@3951 = ~Shut up! Viconia, leave Fade alone! She is *not* a whore, and you are *not* going to antagonize her anymore. Do you understand?~
@3952 = ~Both of you, leave each other alone, unless you invite me from the get go, or at least let me watch, and there's some kind of edible treat involved. Do you get me?~
@3953 = ~Hah! You and your male mind. (She laughs, and pushes your hand from her ear.) I'll be taking a bath. The sweat from that drow has made me feel rather unclean.~
@3954 = ~This is not over yet, Fade. Do not think it is. (She detaches you from her ear as well.) But for <CHARNAME>'s sake, I will wait. When the time is right... ~
@3955 = ~Whatever. (She blows a kiss at Viconia.) I'll see you when it's treat time!~
@3956 = ~Whatever. I don't know why I even bothered.~
@3957 = ~So, you are nothing more than a weak male. I'm glad I found out now!~
@3958 = ~I am only concerned for you, <CHARNAME>. I do not know why that little viper is interested in you.~
@3959 = ~Not that it is any business of yours in the first place!~
@3960 = ~Will you allow me to speak! I... I am worried that her intentions are less than noble... ~
@3961 = ~I think it is up to me as to whether I want to find out how noble Fade's intentions are, don't you, Jaheira? Now, what did you want to ask, Fade?~
@3962 = ~Jaheira, why the concern? There's nothing for you to be worried about. I have no interest in Fade.~
@3963 = ~You... don't?~
@3964 = ~No, he does not! And it is nothing, <CHARNAME>... I am just looking out for you.~
@3965 = ~I... see. Well, I shall leave you both to it, then!~
@3966 = ~Only if you're alright. You seem to be very tired.~
@3967 = ~Hmmm. That paladin over there, he seems rather familiar... ~
@3968 = ~Hold your tongue in this most holy of places, demoness. If it wasn't for <CHARNAME>, I wouldn't even let you set foot in here!~
@3969 = ~There's no need to get so worked up. I was only innocently remarking that I recognized one of these so-called knights... ~
@3970 = ~And I've just remembered where from! Does the Order do much business in the Docks District?~
@3971 = ~The docks? The Order go wherever they are needed, and so I expect they might... if there was a good reason.~
@3972 = ~(grin) Oh, there was a good reason all right. A couple of pretty blond half-elven twins with a broad outlook on life and virtue, if I remember correctly... ~
@3973 = ~Harlot! How dare you sully this place with your disgusting accusations!~
@3974 = ~I'm not *accusing* anyone, Anomen. It isn't an *accusation*. It's a fact!~
@3975 = ~Shut up! No longer shall I listen to your forked tongue!~
@3976 = ~(laugh) Poor, innocent Anomen, didn't even realize the Order got up--~
@3977 = ~Be silent, foul succubus-spawn! I shall not allow you to disparage the Order in this way!~
@3978 = ~Tut tut... temper, temper!~
@3979 = ~I must say, <CHARNAME>, I cannot even begin to comprehend why you actually allow that... that *fiendling* to travel with us! She is incorrigible!~
@3980 = ~Oh, I don't know, Anomen, she's quite fun to be around.~
@3981 = ~I know what you mean, Anomen, but she's very useful and a skilled fighter... and I need all the help I can get if I want to get Imoen back.~
@3982 = ~It's nothing to do with me, Anomen. Sort it out between yourselves!~
@3983 = ~Aerie... all I can hear is you muttering to yourself when you look my way. If you have a problem with me, please tell me to my face.~
@3984 = ~Oh! I... it's nothing Fade... I just... ~
@3985 = ~Come on, little fancy, spit it out.~
@3986 = ~It's just... just that I've heard of your people, Fade. That they are cruel a-and evil and torture for fun! That they willingly corrupted themselves, simply to gain power. I... sometimes w-wonder about your intention here, that's all.~
@3987 = ~I do believe you are casting aspersions on my character based solely upon rumours of my heritage. Or maybe I misinterpreted what you meant... ~
@3988 = ~I... I... didn't intend to insult you, Fade, but... you cannot blame me for my caution... I have n-nothing against you personally, but I do sometimes wonder if <CHARNAME> knows about your people. It's something <PRO_HESHE> needs to know about!~
@3989 = ~Needs to know? And just who are you to judge this?~
@3990 = ~I... I wasn't j-judging you, I w-was just... ~
@3991 = ~So exactly what were you doing? (sigh) Aerie, I'm not patronising or berating you. Of course I know how my people are perceived, and believe me, the reality is worse than any rumour. But that doesn't mean we're *all* like that.~
@3992 = ~It's the same for your people. What about the Avariel who murdered children, who ate their bloody, still beating hearts from their chests as their life force slipped away?~
@3993 = ~N-no!! That n-never h-happened! No Avariel would ever do that!!~
@3994 = ~No? How can you be so sure? I've heard such rumours... in fact this particular tale is a favourite amongst my people.~
@3995 = ~The point is, just because you belong to a certain caste or race doesn't necessarily mean you all act the same. Your experiences also shape who you are... who you'll be. You're already different from your Avariel kin, and not just physically... ~
@3996 = ~T-that's a cruel thing to say! I may not have my wings, but I'm still... still... ~
@3997 = ~Maybe you're right. I am different now. But I didn't ask for it!~
@3998 = ~Neither did I. It may surprise and dismay you to know I didn't change out of some greater purpose or realisation... I *liked* my previous life. It was easy... I could do as I wished... But now I have to get on with being what I am now.~
@3999 = ~As we all do. Just concentrate on being you.~
@4000 = ~I... I just wanted to say that I was very sorry to hear about your capture and subsequent incarceration, Aerie.~
@4001 = ~Wh-what? Why should you care? I mean... I wouldn't have thought you would even have considered it.~
@4002 = ~Well, I have, and if you ever need... you know... someone to talk to about it... well, you know where I am.~
@4003 = ~Th-thank you Fade. Although I don't know if you could be of any help to me.~
@4004 = ~You'd be surprised, Aerie--I think we have more in common than you could ever imagine.~
@4005 = ~I must say, I still cannot believe that <CHARNAME> even allowed you to join us, Fade. Let it be known that I shall never trust you, and whilst you travel with us, I shall always be watching you.~
@4006 = ~*Always* be watching me, Anomen? I'm sure I could have you arrested for that.~
@4007 = ~I suppose I should have expected such a response from one of your kind. Never did I think I would have to travel with a Shadow Thief!~
@4008 = ~Well, now, that's unfortunate, isn't it? Especially since <CHARNAME>'s joined our ranks and everything. I would say you're outnumbered, Anomen.~
@4009 = ~Well, <CHARNAME> is the one calling the shots here, not you, so I think you can just toddle off back to your position and concentrate on being righteous, while the rest of us have some fun.~
@4010 = ~That's some mighty shiny armour you're wearing, Anomen.~
@4011 = ~Well, it doesn't do oneself any favours to look a disgrace, does it?~
@4012 = ~No, it doesn't. Although I do suppose people may wonder when you get the time to polish it. Considering all the heroic things you've done, I'm surprised you even have the time to sit down, let alone polish your helmet until it gleams... (flutters her eyelashes at Anomen)~
@4013 = ~What?!~
@4014 = ~Well... all that rubbing? It takes time! No wonder you've got such a nice, strong right arm. (grin)~
@4015 = ~Why must you bring down everything I say to the basest of levels? I... I tire of talking to you, fiendling. Leave me be!~
@4016 = ~Cernd, has it ever occurred to you that nature can be a cruel mistress?~
@4017 = ~What makes you say that?~
@4018 = ~Well... I look around myself and everywhere I see bloodshed and death. I have always been led to believe that nature was the soft option... but now I'm not so sure.~
@4019 = ~(smile) Nature never takes the "soft option"... and we often learn that the hard way. We expect nature to be benevolent, but she knows the way of things. It's better to serve the balance and make sure what happens benefits all.~
@4020 = ~Fade, are you a planar creature?~
@4021 = ~No, I don't think so. (grin) Creature, maybe, but I hail from around here.~
@4022 = ~It is just that your aura is a trifle... strange. I know of your people, but you are somewhat of an enigma.~
@4023 = ~So it isn't just the tail and the talons, then?~
@4024 = ~No. I am used to those who walk so far from nature's path coming from strange and wondrous places, that is all.~
@4025 = ~I walk outside of nature? What do you mean?~
@4026 = ~Your place in nature's grand scheme is... uncertain.~
@4027 = ~So I'm unnatural?~
@4028 = ~No. (smile) Just different.~
@4029 = ~Edwin! Here's one for you... how many Red Wizards does it take to change a candle?~
@4030 = ~None. We have servants like you to do it for us.~
@4031 = ~You there! Yes, you--slave girl! Come here and rub my feet.~
@4032 = ~Are you talking to *me*?~
@4033 = ~(Deaf as well as stupid, I see) Yes, of course I am! Who else do you think I refer to? Now get to it.~
@4034 = ~How dare you! You demand I rub your feet--how about I cut them off?!~
@4035 = ~Bah! What's the point of having servants if they won't do as they're told?~
@4036 = ~You really should make more of those beautiful curves you have, "Edwina". You know, lift and separate? (waggles her eyebrows)~
@4037 = ~No! Not you as well, you miserable wench! I swear, once I am restored, all of you shall pay for your incessant teasing! (I must be rid of this soon; the urge to talk about kittens, the preoccupation with my weight and hair, the constant indignity of other men peering down my cleavage... it is too much!)~
@4038 = ~Sometimes you surprise me, bard. For all your doom and gloom, I see you looking about you with the wonder, dare I say, of a child given a new gift. Surely you are used to such small things on this plane by now.~
@4039 = ~Ahhh, my magpie, everything I witness is a small miracle to this humble sparrow. Where chaos coalesces and forms such beauty... to know that everything is different from one second to the next, and that in one fateful second, all could crumble and fall into oblivion... ~
@4040 = ~We walk upon the edge of a knife, and yet we walk it willingly, seemingly oblivious that if we stray but one step too far, we will fall from existence into nothingness, to decay, to be forgotten... ~
@4041 = ~So I suppose the message is "seize the day", then?~
@4042 = ~(grin) Yes, you could say that.~
@4043 = ~Good advice.~
@4044 = ~I've got some good advice too, you know, if you'd care to hear it... ~
@4045 = ~Really? And that would be... ?~
@4046 = ~(sweetly) "Get your hand off my backside".~
@4047 = ~Have you ever travelled to Sigil?~
@4048 = ~No... never.~
@4049 = ~You surprise me, magpie! I know of your history--the Hellgate Saga is indeed an interesting one--but do the Planes not call to you?~
@4050 = ~Not really. Since the only other Plane I have had contact with is the Abyss, it hasn't done anything to whet my appetite to visit others.~
@4051 = ~But Sigil is a great city. Cruel, but exhilarating; brutal, but beautiful. Great heroes and villains walk its crooked streets, and there is adventure to be found at every turn. Ahhh... the Primes think they know of diversity and excitement, but compared to Sigil, there is nothing but routine and the mundane.~
@4052 = ~Well, if Sigil is so great, why are you here?~
@4053 = ~Discovery and exploration has her claws in this humble sparrow, and for all that Sigil has to recommend it, how else can I experience what the Prime has to offer? One day I will return... but until then, I shall travel.~
@4054 = ~So what made you turn your life as a sneak into a spell thrower?~
@4055 = ~(grin) I'm not sure. Shiny things are nice, but being able to manipulate raw arcane power... that's something else!~
@4056 = ~I suppose so, although it's been a long time since I cast any spells.~
@4057 = ~You were a spell caster once? What happened?~
@4058 = ~I lost my powers. I had a certain amount of innate magical power. My tutors tried to teach me how to use it properly, but I really couldn't be arsed. (sigh) Then I lost it. I kind of regret it.~
@4059 = ~So... how did you lose your powers? Did you just wake up one morning and find them gone?~
@4060 = ~No, I lost them gradually. (sigh) You... you know I was a slave? Well, a slave with magical powers doesn't make a good slave. I was forced to wear manacles that suppressed my magic. Whether it was the years of not using it, or whether the manacles themselves somehow sucked the magic right out of me, I don't know. Still--too late for regrets. We are what life makes us... and there's nothing we can do about it!~
@4061 = ~What was it like, growing up with <CHARNAME>? Were you as bad as <PRO_HESHE> likes to make out?~
@4062 = ~Me? The bad one? Hardly! <PRO_HESHE> was always blaming me for everything, getting me into trouble, saying I was the one who kept stealing the cookies, that I was the one who distracted <PRO_HIMHER> from <PRO_HISHER> chores and studies... (grin)~
@4063 = ~(wink) Ahhh. I guessed that might be the case.~
@4064 = ~You'd never know from that innocent little expression, would you?~
@4065 = ~So... stealing cookies, right? How often did you manage that?~
@4066 = ~A lot more times that I would care to admit, Fade. Well, in the presence of <CHARNAME>, anyway!~
@4067 = ~All the time you speak of the "balance" of things... yet how can you know what balances what?~
@4068 = ~What? Balance is important. To tip one's hand too far, whether in the name of "good" or "evil", will inevitably lead to chaos in nature. This cannot be.~
@4069 = ~But if nature is so powerful, surely she can prevent it herself?~
@4070 = ~Look at yourself, Fade. You are one who walks out of balance, yet you still exist. Nature will encompass you, but she cannot change you or make you walk her path.~
@4071 = ~I'm not sure whether I have just been insulted or not... but I take your point.~
@4072 = ~Jaheira, who was Khalid?~
@4073 = ~You dare speak his name--~
@4074 = ~No, Jaheira, I don't want any hostilities from you. I'm just curious.~
@4075 = ~I am sorry. My... protectiveness of him seems to follow him in death as it did in life. Khalid was... my husband.~
@4076 = ~I see. Then I am sincerely sorry for your loss--~
@4077 = ~I do not need your pity, Fade. Such sentiments do his memory no favours. You did not know him. Let us leave it at that.~
@4078 = ~Jan... those *things* on your head... can I ask what purpose they serve?~
@4079 = ~Why yes! They are part of my Jansen AdventureWear (patent pending, of course!) collection. They enhance vision so that even the most minuscule of things become clearly visible! Useful things for people involved in our line of work, don't you think?~
@4080 = ~Yes... but you mentioned a collection. You invent other things too?~
@4081 = ~Oh indeed! And not just AdventureWear... I started with special devices for turnip preparation, just to make everyone's life that little bit easier. Imagine the possibilities! The Jansen Preparer... all those hours spent slaving over hot turnips, gone!~
@4082 = ~Although many connoisseurs in the field may argue that the love would be taken away from turnip preparation by the device, I think it would mean people could devote more time to other pursuits, such as... oh, I don't know, art or turnip cultivation. It's just that Uncle Spanky always did enjoy taking his time with a good turnip... ~
@4083 = ~Uncle... Spanky? Please don't tell me you're referring to another turnip preparing device... ~
@4084 = ~(grin) Oh no, now you're thinking of the--~
@4085 = ~Okay! I get the point. I really don't want to know.~
@4086 = ~But the Turnip Extractor would revolutionise--~
@4087 = ~Please! That's enough! I really, *really* don't want any more mental pictures about novel and exotic uses for turnips... ~
@4088 = ~Novel and exotic uses? Turnips are a part of life, and so should be welcomed into all aspects of our day-to-day living. Why, Aunt Levidia swore that a once weekly bath in turnips did wonders for her complexion... I know! I'll dig out her recipe for Age-Defying, Skin-Enhancing Special Turnip Body Scrub!~
@4089 = ~What?? Number one... are you saying I look old or something? And number two... why would I want to plaster mashed root vegetables all over my body?~
@4090 = ~(Jan only grins and waggles his eyebrows)~
@4091 = ~Ewww!~
@4092 = ~Here, Fade, take this. Just a little present from a humble gnomish inventor.~
@4093 = ~Err... a jar full of some... greenish... cream? What is this, Jan?~
@4094 = ~I said I'd make you some of Aunt Levidia's Age-Defying Turnip Body Scrub... well, there you are. Recipe number 5, much sought after, I can tell you. Second Cousin Milos felt the back of Aunt Levidia's hand for trying to steal this recipe from her, and to say that she knocked him into next week would be an understatement.~
@4095 = ~So how come you have it? If Aunt... Levidia... guarded the recipe so jealously... ~
@4096 = ~There are ways and means, Fade, ways and means... ~
@4097 = ~(grin) You're a gnome after my own heart, Jan. (sniff) The smell's rather... overpowering.~
@4098 = ~Well, if you don't use it all, it doubles up as a delicious party dip. (sigh) Oh, Aunt Levidia's Anti-Aging No. 5... not for the youngsters, though. Eat too much and you won't be able to look at crudites in the same light again. Rather like Second Cousin Milos. He'd heard the rumours surrounding recipe's more... *rejuvenating* properties and decided he wanted it for himself. Terribly afflicted with boils, was Milos, and prone to hair loss too. He wanted to find a Djinni to grant him a wish, you see, but he knew a better deal when one came knocking!~
@4099 = ~Aunt Levidia kept her store of No. 5 well-guarded and warded from prying eyes... never before has gnomish ingenuity involving things with spikes been employed with such ruthless efficiency!~
@4100 = ~Did I mention that Milos suffered from boils? He smelt bad too... the stench was sometimes almost indescribable! It didn't seem to come from anywhere in particular... it just seemed to hang around him, emanating from every pore, insinuating itself into your sinuses until it was all you could smell... no word of it a lie. *Wolves* would run from Second Cousin Milos's stench. And his boils.~
@4101 = ~With hindsight, though, his stench could have come from his belief in plastering his head with manure in the hope it would make his hair grow back. He preferred horse, but would go with anything at a pinch... ~
@4102 = ~Err... yes... Thanks for the... scrub, Jan. Much appreciated... I think.~
@4103 = ~What does it feel like to have faith?~
@4104 = ~What kind of question is that to ask anyone, Fade?~
@4105 = ~Well, you are a paladin and all... I just thought you would be the best person to ask.~
@4106 = ~I suppose I am as good as any, but it's still a surprising question. Are you saying you have no faith at all--in anything? I thought that even... thieves... had their own deities.~
@4107 = ~Come now, Keldorn. Thief I may be, but we're not all bad.~
@4108 = ~Please, forgive an old paladin for his even older misconceptions and prejudices. I know you are good of heart, if not necessarily of deed.~
@4109 = ~(grin) How could I not forgive you? But still... back to my question.~
@4110 = ~Faith... let me see... it is hard to explain. For me, it is like having a guiding light--Torm shows me the way. He protects me, and my family. I know I am safe in his care, so I trust him implicitly. I do not flounder under his tutelage; my life has purpose.~
@4111 = ~That sounds like a... nice way to live. But what if you come into conflict with him? Would Torm put up with that?~
@4112 = ~And why would I come into conflict with my God? It would be like conflicting with myself.~
@4113 = ~Fade, I fear I am trying to explain something to you that is very personal to each individual. I hope that you do one day gain a faith... something that gives you something to believe in.~
@4114 = ~You know, you're totally different from what I imagined a paladin would be like. I had thought them all stuffy, meddling, over-pious do-gooders... but you're not.~
@4115 = ~So then, elf, the blood o' demons runs through them pretty veins o' yours? Never thought squeakies would have it in 'em to embrace such practices... makes a refreshing change from huggin' trees, I suppose.~
@4116 = ~I am a Fey'ri, dwarf, yes.~
@4117 = ~I'm likin' the sound of that... and I'm likin' this, too... gives ye somethin' to, ye know, grab on to... ~
@4118 = ~What are you-- Let go of my tail!~
@4119 = ~Ouch! Har har, landed me a good sharp slap there, girlie! Aye, the fiendling squeakie's got fire in her belly! I be knowin' a good draught that'll be quenching those flames, lass. (grin)~
@4120 = ~(growl) And so do I! It's called blood!~
@4121 = ~Fire in her belly, I said! Ah, don't be gettin' yer knickers in a twist, lass. Letting go now, I am.~
@4122 = ~(growl) I should gut you where you stand... I *will* make you pay for that!~
@4123 = ~(grin) That a promise?~
@4124 = ~You... you... (growl) You WILL pay.~
@4125 = ~Piss off, Korgan! You touch me one more time, and I'm going to gut you!~
@4126 = ~(grin) Aye? And then?~
@4127 = ~And then I'll slit your throat... ~
@4128 = ~Ohh, lassie... ye talks dirty fer a squeakie... ~
@4129 = ~And then... and then I'll plait ribbons in your beard. Pink ones, for preference.~
@4130 = ~Ach, no! Ye had to go and spoil it, din't ye, y'stupid wench!~
@4131 = ~And then I might paint flowers on your armour... nice roses, or maybe petunias. What do you think?~
@4132 = ~Ye're a sicko, ye know that? Nothin' more than a no good squeakie after all.~
@4133 = ~(grin) Awww... ickle Korgan doesn't like flowers and ribbons. (She strokes his beard and then unconsciously wipes her hand down the front of her britches)~
@4134 = ~(wink) Ye're an evil wench, Fade--a right down n' dirty wumman. If ye could only be growin' a beard now... ~
@4135 = ~I must admit, Fade, you are something of a puzzle to me. You are of obviously demonic heritage, and whilst you have an undeniable cruel and wanton edge, you also seem capable of great compassion. You veritably swirl with the chaos that seethes so obviously within you.~
@4136 = ~Have you not considered trying to stabilise yourself a little... maybe find an anchor?~
@4137 = ~Well, that was quite a compliment, Mazzy. Although by an "anchor", I believe you are referring to some kow-towing, experience-fearing religion of some kind... ~
@4138 = ~What do you mean by that? I have found great solace in Arvoreen. He is a positive influence for me, and has enriched my life greatly! I just thought that you too might find your centre through a higher purpose.~
@4139 = ~(snort) Find my centre? Enrich my life? My life is rich enough already, for good or ill. I don't need an imaginary friend perching on my shoulder telling me what I should and shouldn't do.~
@4140 = ~Imaginary friend? But the gods exist! You know this... everyone knows this!~
@4141 = ~Oh, I know they exist. What I meant is the *relationship* you allegedly have with the gods is imaginary. Without believers, they are weak. They therefore drain us of our strength. And I give my strength to no one... I need it for myself!~
@4142 = ~Then I pity you, Fade, for your lack of spirituality.~
@4143 = ~(shrug) It means I answer to and rely on no one but myself... and I am more than happy for it to be this way.~
@4144 = ~No one? Not even <CHARNAME>?~
@4145 = ~I... don't know what you mean.~
@4146 = ~(smile knowingly) As you would have it, Fade.~
@4147 = ~So, Mazzy, you're some kind of god-bothering fighter then? What happened, got kicked out of the family business?~
@4148 = ~Family business? What are you talking about?~
@4149 = ~Well, thieving, of course. Everyone knows every halfling worth his or her salt makes a good sneak... ~
@4150 = ~Thieving?! How dare you! No one in my family has ever stooped so low--~
@4151 = ~(grin) Suuuure they haven't... ~
@4152 = ~No, they haven't! And I would advise you to keep your filthy accusations and aspersions to yourself in future!~
@4153 = ~Why do I get the feeling I've touched a rather raw nerve there, Maz... ~
@4154 = ~This discussion is *over*.~
@4155 = ~Minsc, why are you... scratching at yourself like that?~
@4156 = ~Oh, no, Fade, I am not scratching. Boo has chewed a little hole in my pocket, and even now he has escaped and is making a nest in my armour! At least, I hope he is making a nest... ~
@4157 = ~Boo? Him? You have... something in there?~
@4158 = ~Ahh, yes, Minsc and Boo, never to be separated... HA! I have you now Boo. Come here and meet my friend Fade.~
@4159 = ~(whisper) You mean you haven't heard him constantly refer to him and Boo?~
@4160 = ~(whisper) I just thought he was, you know, imagining things! I didn't actually think Boo existed... ~
@4161 = ~See! Here he is!~
@4162 = ~A RAT! You've got a bloody RAT in your pocket!~
@4163 = ~No, Fade, Boo is a hamster! A miniature giant space hamster. And he is wise and fearless and counsels Minsc in times of trouble, and... ~
@4164 = ~He's got a rat... a rat in his pocket... a RAT I tell you! (tries to bolt away)~
@4165 = ~(Grab her as she bolts) No, Fade, it's OK, Boo is a hamster! Just look at him... he's not a rat... ~
@4166 = ~(Let her go)~
@4167 = ~Fade, Boo has been saying that you might be a... naughty thief. Please tell me this is not true!~
@4168 = ~Minsc--I'm a Shadow Thief! What did you think I was?~
@4169 = ~Maybe a cook... or a guard. I see you doing good, but Boo says you take things that do not belong to you, and that is not good.~
@4170 = ~Well... sometimes I do. But it's all in a good cause! I only take things from bad people... and the money goes to helping us on our, err, righteous mission.~
@4171 = ~See, Boo? No, do not tell tales! Fade is our friend, on the path to righteousness via the route of naughtiness! Minsc was right!~
@4172 = ~Minsc, what are you doing? Why are you... peering at my bottom?~
@4173 = ~Minsc and Boo were just wondering how it was attached.~
@4174 = ~What? How *what* is attached?~
@4175 = ~Your tail! Never has Minsc seen such a thing. Boo hasn't either. He has a tail, but it isn't long as yours. Do you buckle it on?~
@4176 = ~No! It's part of me!~
@4177 = ~Part... of you? But in Boo's experience, women do not have tails.~
@4178 = ~And Boo has had much experience of women, I take it?~
@4179 = ~We-ell, Boo has not told Minsc for sure, but Boo is very smart at getting into places no man or hamster has ever reached... so Minsc thinks, maybe!~
@4180 = ~Get out of my way, rich kid.~
@4181 = ~What? I wasn't anywhere near you!~
@4182 = ~I can see you, and that's enough for me.~
@4183 = ~What is your problem with me, Fade? I don't see you being this beastly to anyone else.~
@4184 = ~My "problem" with you is that you have no idea of what you're talking about. If I have to hear about how you "help the needy" one more time, I'm going to be sick.~
@4185 = ~And what is wrong with that? Maybe you don't realise--or maybe you just don't care--but they need all the help I can give them!~
@4186 = ~Oh? Really? So how did your lounging around in your huge castle while they toiled in the fields to ensure there was food on your table help them, exactly? By giving them employment?~
@4187 = ~I cannot help it if I was born privileged! I have never been cruel to any of the castle's servants. I have always treated them with respect, and spared a coin when I could.~
@4188 = ~A right little Ilmater, aren't you? Ever thought about giving them enough so they didn't have to slave for you anymore? No, I didn't think so. Just... go away.~
@4189 = ~I can't help but feel that we have got off on the wrong foot. I know about your causes, and I believe in them too! I just wish you would give me a chance.~
@4190 = ~A chance? I don't think so. Live in the gutter for a month, and then we'll speak. Until then, you have no clue what real suffering is about, Nalia... none at all.~
@4191 = ~Would you look at the size of those bear prints, Valygar! I wouldn't like to come across a bear of that size.~
@4192 = ~You wouldn't have anything to worry about if you left the bear alone. They only attack when threatened or disturbed.~
@4193 = ~Or you could do that special animal command thing... ~
@4194 = ~(sigh) Fade, I would never *command* an animal to do anything.~
@4195 = ~(grin) But haven't you got... animal charms, Valygar?~
@4196 = ~Well, that--~
@4197 = ~(sigh) Whatever, Fade. Whatever.~
@4198 = ~Why so glum, chum?~
@4199 = ~Fade, if you are going to be insufferably perky, can you do it to someone else? I am in no mood for it today.~
@4200 = ~(sigh) Come on, Valygar, there's no need to be so sour. Just a smile--one small smile. Is that so hard?~
@4201 = ~Yes, it is. Please, just leave me be.~
@4202 = ~Come on... smile... ~
@4203 = ~Fade... ~
@4204 = ~Smile... let's see those lovely lips of yours in something other than a frown... ~
@4205 = ~Pardon?~
@4206 = ~(grin) See what depths I will subject myself to? Or am I going to have to sink even lower and tickle you too?~
@4207 = ~You know, you remind me a lot of me sometimes, Viconia.~
@4208 = ~I seriously doubt that, naut kleel uss. You come from the gutter. I do not. Let us leave it at that.~
@4209 = ~No... you may not like it, but we have a lot in common. (smiles sweetly) I used to be an unpleasant, bitter old bitch too, you know.~
@4210 = ~Indeed? Well I have *never* been a gutter whore, so I fail to see any similarities between us. Bwael tangi, Fade... xun naut vrine'winith ulu sevir ussta llanath. That is to say--Good day... do not hesitate to leave my presence.~
@4211 = ~Why do you persist in keeping that... protrusion, Fade?~
@4212 = ~Protrusion? You mean my tail? Well, it's not like I can just get rid of it--it's part of me!~
@4213 = ~You could have cut it off. I could easily arrange that for you. It wouldn't hurt... much.~
@4214 = ~Get away, Viconia! I don't *want* to lose my tail! It's part of who I am.~
@4215 = ~Hmmm? Part of who you are? I suppose there is some truth in that statement. Many animals have tails... so why shouldn't you?~
@4216 = ~So, little Shadow Thief! We are working together.~
@4217 = ~No, I don't think we are. We are simply helping out the same person.~
@4218 = ~What is that? Surely you do not share Renal's disdain? We should work together!~
@4219 = ~My Shadow Master warned me of you, thieving on our patch without the backing of the guild. How do we know you aren't a spy for the other guild?~
@4220 = ~You wound me! I am but an honest thief; never have I plotted against the Shadow Thieves, nor against the Shadow Master. I was simply trying to survive.~
@4221 = ~Honest thief? A bit of an oxymoron... remember who you are speaking to! But I'm watching you, Yoshimo. Any treachery, and you *will* be dealt with.~
@4222 = ~You... *like* her? Well, I'll leave you both to it, then!~
@4223 = ~I understand, <CHARNAME>, but even so... (sigh)~
@4224 = ~See? See how small and furry his face is! Boo is no rat. Would you like to hold him? Maybe that would make you feel better... ~
@4225 = ~But Boo is so small and furry... Fade! Do not be afraid! Boo will not hurt you, not unless I command him to--~
@4226 = ~Well, all right, Boo, fair enough, not unless I ask you to, yes, I know, there is a big difference between being commanded and being asked... ~
@4227 = ~Don't worry Minsc, I'm sure she'll come round. And I'd, uh, better go and see if she's OK.~
@4228 = ~You... you side with this... this... nuij? Bah! (She slaps your hand away from her.) Go be the animals you both are. You disgust me.~
@4229 = ~Why do you constantly bombard him with questions? Can't you see he doesn't have any interest in you?~
@4230 = ~<CHARNAME> is... is a good man, Fade. He doesn't need the likes of you.~
@4231 = ~And exactly who are you to make this judgement, little fancy?~
@4232 = ~I... I just think you should stay away, thief!~
@4233 = ~Ahhh... protecting <CHARNAME>'s virtue, are we Aerie? Or hoping he'll steal yours?~
@4234 = ~Don't be so disgusting!~
@4235 = ~But I'm right, aren't I?~
@4236 = ~<CHARNAME>... please make her go away!~
@4237 = ~Fade, leave Aerie alone, period. She's only looking out for me.~
@4238 = ~I'll do nothing of the sort, Aerie. I happen to like Fade.~
@4239 = ~(sigh) Again the fiendling speaks as if <CHARNAME> is in any shape or form interested in her. I don't know why I don't just banish you back to the Abyss, jalil.~
@4240 = ~I don't come from the Abyss, Viconia. And I am only answering a question <CHARNAME> posed to me last we spoke.~
@4241 = ~No doubt through some misguided notion of politeness on his behalf, I am sure. And you say you don't come from the Abyss? (sniff) Well, you certainly smell as if you do... ~
@4242 = ~You bitch!~
@4243 = ~Ahhh... the last response of the intellectually challenged.~
@4244 = ~Fade, ignore her. She's just trying to get a reaction out of you. You were about to tell me of your upbringing? Go on.~
@4245 = ~Although there's no reason to be quite so insulting, Viconia is right. My interest in your upbringing has waned.~
@4246 = ~Apologising *again*, fiendling? My, my. Those knees of yours must be rubbed raw.~
@4247 = ~(growl) Shut up, drow.~
@4248 = ~I have told you before--do not speak to your betters in such a way, or I *will* have your tongue ripped from your mouth.~
@4249 = ~Really? I'd like to see you try!~
@4250 = ~So unstable... really, <CHARNAME>, why you would allow *that* anywhere near you is beyond me.~
@4251 = ~Oh, and I suppose you have far more to offer?~
@4252 = ~(laugh) You know I do, iblith.~
@4253 = ~And so do I. Sorry, Fade, but Viconia does have a point.~
@4254 = ~Viconia, if you think for one second I am interested in you, you're sadly mistaken. Now, Fade, what were you saying?~
@4255 = ~Oh, shut it, the pair of you. I've had enough. I'm not interested in either of you, okay?~
@4256 = ~Of course he's tired! But I do not believe for one second that you are concerned about his welfare, succubus.~
@4257 = ~Although you may this hard to believe, I *am* concerned about <CHARNAME>'s welfare. That role is not yours alone.~
@4258 = ~Role? I don't know what you're talking about.~
@4259 = ~Oh please, Jaheira. I see the possessive little glances, the constant disdain of any other female company... it's pathetic.~
@4260 = ~Pathetic, you say? No more pathetic than your constant posturing and approval seeking, thief!~
@4261 = ~Oh, go and chew on a tree, Jaheira!~
@4262 = ~Fade, I will not allow you to speak to Jaheira like that! There is no need for it. Apologise to Jaheira!~
@4263 = ~Jaheira, Fade was only asking a question. Why won't you cut her some slack?~
@4264 = ~Oh, for the love of... pack it in, you two! Or at least bicker elsewhere!~
@4265 = ~(Fade looks up at your approach, one crimson eyebrow quirked inquiringly.) Yes, <CHARNAME>?~
@4266 = ~(Hold Fade's hand)~
@4267 = ~(Put your arm around her)~
@4268 = ~(Wink at Fade)~
@4269 = ~How are you feeling, Fade?~
@4270 = ~(Brush a lock of hair from her face)~
@4271 = ~(Smile at Fade)~
@4272 = ~Fade, maybe you should stand closer to me in battle. I... I don't like seeing you get hurt, is all.~
@4273 = ~(Touch Fade's tail)~
@4274 = ~Those tattoos on your face--do they mean anything?~
@4275 = ~(Tickle Fade)~
@4276 = ~(Kiss her hand)~
@4277 = ~(Watch her as she walks)~
@4278 = ~Fade, I'm curious. Your name seems more like a description than a real one. Is it just a nickname?~
@4279 = ~Fade, I think you may have misjudged our friendship. I like you, just not in the way you think I do. Sorry.~
@4280 = ~(She looks down at your intertwined fingers and smiles to herself. You then feel her caress your palm with her thumb.)~
@4281 = ~(She holds your entwined hands up and begins to study your fingers. She then brings your hand to her lips and kisses each one of your fingers lightly.)~
@4282 = ~(Step closer to her and copy her)~
@4283 = ~(smile) What have I done to deserve that?~
@4284 = ~(She smiles and a slight flush touches her cheeks.)~
@4285 = ~(She gives you a rather enigmatic smile and shrugs.) Nothing in particular... ~
@4286 = ~(At first she looks a bit unsure of what to do, but just as you think she is going to walk away from you, she snakes an arm around your waist with, you have to admit to yourself, a rather self-satisfied smile.)~
@4287 = ~(grin) Why the smile? You look like a cat that's gotten into the cream.~
@4288 = ~(grin and hold her tighter to you)~
@4289 = ~Funnily enough, that's exactly how I feel.~
@4290 = ~(Her smile widens and she nuzzles her head against your shoulder, and to your surprise, nips your ear gently.)~
@4291 = ~And what was that for? You're acting like a cat that's gotten into the cream.~
@4292 = ~(Fade jumps slightly and pulls away from you, obviously a little startled by your sudden close proximity. Suddenly, she laughs and makes a show of ruffling your hair. Whether she is truly joking or trying to hide her previous discomfiture, you're not entirely sure.)~
@4293 = ~(She winks back, and then with a cheeky grin, pokes her tongue out at you.)~
@4294 = ~(As Fade catches your wink, she turns a vivid shade of red and bites her bottom lip almost coyly.)~
@4295 = ~I have a few scratches, <CHARNAME>, but I'll be okay. Thank you for asking.~
@4296 = ~(She smiles warmly at you.) I'm fine, <CHARNAME>...  no complaints here.~
@4297 = ~Well, I'm cold, tired and feeling a bit cranky... . but the company I am with more than makes up for that. (smile)~
@4298 = ~(As you brush the lock away, she catches your hand and holds it against her cheek for a moment before releasing it.)~
@4299 = ~You're as bad as Pelanna! (She adopts a commanding voice.) "Get your hair out of your face! How are you supposed to be able to see anything with that hay-stack in the way?!" (grin)~
@4300 = ~Hay-stack? Hardly. More like a curtain of molten copper.~
@4301 = ~Well, she does have a point.~
@4302 = ~I've had my hair described as many things, but molten copper? Never. (She leans over and tweaks your nose playfully.)~
@4303 = ~(Tweak hers back)~
@4304 = ~(grin) Pack it in! Although I suppose Pelanna does have a point... ~
@4305 = ~Oh? And what point would that be? That I can't see anything, or that my hair looks like a haystack?~
@4306 = ~Well, it's not so much *you* can't see anything. It just means you're hiding that pretty face of yours from me.~
@4307 = ~(She giggles and slaps your hand away playfully.) Oh, stop it <CHARNAME>! Anyway, what I do with my hair is my business.~
@4308 = ~Well, it's my business as well when you hide that pretty face of yours from me.~
@4309 = ~(She looks away from you, biting her bottom lip.) You are such a tease, <CHARNAME>, it's unbelievable... ~
@4310 = ~(She smiles back at you.) You're in a good mood. What's brought this on?~
@4311 = ~Oh, nothing really. It's a nice day--what isn't there to smile about?~
@4312 = ~Well, it's a nice day, and I'm with good company. Why shouldn't I be smiling?~
@4313 = ~(She cocks her head to one side as if scrutinizing you.) You know, you have a really lovely smile, <CHARNAME>. It really lights up your whole face.~
@4314 = ~So... what you're saying is that I look like a right miserable bastard the rest of the time, right?~
@4315 = ~Oh, now I *know* you're teasing!~
@4316 = ~Yes, it's nice to be out and about, not having to watch over your shoulder all the time. (sigh) Unfortunately, working for the Guild means there is always someone out there willing to sell you out. It's a shame, really. I like being with someone who isn't like that, I really do.~
@4317 = ~(laugh) That's not what I said! I think you look lovely all... I mean, I don't think that... ummm... I'm not saying... I just think...~
@4318 = ~Oh, just take the compliment! I'm shutting up now before I screw this up any further!~
@4319 = ~No, it's true. I... I think you have a very attractive smile, <CHARNAME>. I mean, I'm sure I'm not alone in this opinion, and that there are plenty of other people out there who feel the same way... I mean, *think* the same way I do...~
@4320 = ~(She smiles back at you almost cheekily, looks around to see if anyone is watching her and then tips you a sly wink.)~
@4321 = ~(She gives you a searching look.) O-okay... as long as you're sure. I don't want to get in your way.~
@4322 = ~What are you saying? That you think I'm crap in battle? (grin) Okay... if it keeps you happy.~
@4323 = ~(smile) Again, I'm not sure if that is a compliment or an insult, but I shall take it as a compliment. Thank you for your... concern, <CHARNAME>.~
@4324 = ~(sigh) What is it about my tail that fascinates people so? Wherever I go, people have to stare and try to touch it.~
@4325 = ~(Withdraw your hand) Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.~
@4326 = ~(grin) Do you think it could be because seeing an elf with a tail is not considered normal?~
@4327 = ~(smile) It's okay. You can touch it if you'd like to.~
@4328 = ~(Touch her tail)~
@4329 = ~No, it's okay. I'd rather not, now.~
@4330 = ~(She smiles happily.) Nothing normal about me! Still, it would be nice if people *asked* rather than just grabbing it.~
@4331 = ~But I didn't grab it. I just wanted to see what it felt like.~
@4332 = ~(Her tail is warm and sinewy, and to your surprise it has a light dusting of scales near to the base. Intrigued, you lightly rub one of the scales. At this you feel Fade shiver and take a quick indrawn breath. Looking up at her, you see that her eyes are half-lidded and slightly unfocused.)~
@4333 = ~(Quickly withdraw your hand) Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you!~
@4334 = ~(Rub the scales again and grin) You like that, huh?~
@4335 = ~(sniff) Okay, whatever. I really don't care.~
@4336 = ~(She raises an eyebrow at you.) Okay...  go ahead.~
@4337 = ~(She shivers again.) I wouldn't say that hurts, <CHARNAME>. In fact, it's quite the opposite...  (She gives you a rather engimatic smile.)~
@4338 = ~(She closes her eyes and nods. You feel her shiver again.) Possibly more than I should do, <CHARNAME>... ~
@4339 = ~Oi! That's not a toy, you know!~
@4340 = ~(She looks thoughtful for a moment and then grins) Unlike the rest of me, of course... ~
@4341 = ~(sigh) Yes... it's a tail.~
@4342 = ~Oh, ummm... I know I shouldn't, but it's just so, you know...~
@4343 = ~Can you do tricks with this? You know, like hanging on to things?~
@4344 = ~(grin) Yes, I know it's unusual. Just be grateful I don't have great big flapping wings!~
@4345 = ~(She raises an eyebrow.) "Hanging on to things"? I'm not some kind of chimpanzee, <CHARNAME>!~
@4346 = ~I never said you were! I just wondered what use a tail would be.~
@4347 = ~Considering chimpanzees don't have tails, while monkeys do, I wondered if you could...~
@4348 = ~Apart from the enhanced sense of balance and the obvious ice-breaking talking point? You'd be surprised...~
@4349 = ~Would you like a shovel? Because that's a mighty fine hole you're digging for yourself there, <CHARNAME>. (She offers you a quirky smile.)~
@4350 = ~Many Fey'ri have tattoos--they are usually used to signify rank and clan allegiances. But these don't signify anything, really... I got bored one day and thought they would be a good idea!~
@4351 = ~They don't really mean anything. I have my clan insignia on my back, and my clan position on my belly, but these... these are just decorative. Do... do you like them?~
@4352 = ~No, I don't like tattoos, especially facial ones.~
@4353 = ~Yes, I do. I think they suit you.~
@4354 = ~I don't blame you. I must admit, I was thinking of getting rid of them. But they are also part of who I am, so I'm not so sure. (shrug) Do... do they bother you that much?~
@4355 = ~Yes, I think they are really ugly.~
@4356 = ~No, of course not. It'd take a lot more than a couple of squiggly black lines to mar your beauty.~
@4357 = ~Really? I'm not so sure. I liked them initially, but now I'm kind of fed up with them. I was thinking of getting rid of them, but they are also part of who I am, so I'm not so sure. What do you think?~
@4358 = ~Well, if you don't like them, then get rid of them. It's really up to you.~
@4359 = ~I say keep them. They are part of who you are, and they are really very striking. I think they enhance your beauty.~
@4360 = ~(She gives you a disappointed look.) Oh. I didn't realise they offended you so. (She sniffs slightly disdainfully.) Not that I had them done to please anyone else--I had them done for me, and for me alone. So your opinion counts for nothing.~
@4361 = ~(She blushes, then smiles.) Then I shall keep them. <CHARNAME>. You surely are a charmer, I'll give you that!~
@4362 = ~(grin) I'll probably keep them, in that case. Too much like hard work to get rid of them!~
@4363 = ~(She shrieks and immediately drops to the floor laughing.) Stop it! STOP IT!!~
@4364 = ~I'd hoped you'd be ticklish, but not this ticklish! (Drop to the ground and keep tickling her)~
@4365 = ~Okay, okay, I'm sorry! I didn't know you were quite *that* ticklish!~
@4366 = ~(She squeals with laughter.) NononoNOOOO! (She tries to catch your hands and hold them away from herself.)~
@4367 = ~(Try to catch her hands in turn and pin them under your knees.)~
@4368 = ~(Allow her to catch your hands and pull her on to you.)~
@4369 = ~(She gasps for breath, still giggling.) You horror! Yes, I'm very ticklish! Keep those wandering fingers to yourself!~
@4370 = ~(She keeps trying to struggle, even though you have her firmly pinned to the ground.) Oh, you are SO going to pay for this!~
@4371 = ~(grin) Really? And how are you going to make me pay?~
@4372 = ~Am I? Let's see...  how does the old nursery rhyme go? Oh yes! (Lightly trace circles on her belly.) Round and round the garden... ~
@4373 = ~(She grins triumphantly.) Now I'm going to make you pay, <CHARNAME>! (She starts to tickle you back.)~
@4374 = ~(Just lie there and let her tickle you) I'm not ticklish, Fade.~
@4375 = ~(Try to pretend her tickling isn't having any effect on you) N...  no...  this...  this isn't...  working... ~
@4376 = ~No, this isn't what's supposed to happen! Okay, okay! I won't tickle you anymore--just stop tickling me!~
@4377 = ~(She purses her lips and narrows her eyes at you.) Well...  I don't know yet. But I'll get you back!~
@4378 = ~You will, will you? Let's see...  how does the old nursery rhyme go? Oh yes! (Lightly trace circles on her belly.) Round and round the garden... ~
@4379 = ~Well, I shall wait with bated breath until that time, shan't I?~
@4380 = ~(She giggles uncontrollably and squirms underneath you.) Oh, stop it, *pleeease* stop it!~
@4381 = ~(Shake your head and carry on with your rhyme) ...  like a little bear...  one step...  two steps... ~
@4382 = ~And what will you do to make me stop, hmmm?~
@4383 = ~Hmphf! You're no fun.~
@4384 = ~Oh, but I think it is! (She continues to tickle you.)~
@4385 = ~(She stands up and pulls you up with her.) You won't tickle me anymore? Well, I'm actually quite disappointed, <CHARNAME>... ~
@4386 = ~Just be on your guard, <CHARNAME>--that's all I can say. I can have a pretty broad imagination when I want to.~
@4387 = ~Now I'm *definitely* intrigued.~
@4388 = ~Well, I'll just have to keep you in my sights at all times now, won't I?~
@4389 = ~Please...  I'm begging you...  stop!~
@4390 = ~You're begging me, now? This is something I could get used to. So, what would you do to get me to stop, I wonder?~
@4391 = ~Anything...  anything at all! Just please don't tickle me anymore!~
@4392 = ~Anything, you say? Well, I'm going to have to think long and hard about this.~
@4393 = ~(She pokes out her tongue at you and winks.)~
@4394 = ~(grin) I suppose you will... ~
@4395 = ~Really? Well, I suppose that gives me something to look forward to... ~
@4396 = ~(As soon as she realises your intention, Fade jumps away from you, laughing.) I know what you're up to, <CHARNAME>... pack it in!~
@4397 = ~(She grins as you place your kiss, and then pulls your hand to her own lips. Rather than kissing it, however, she nibbles one of your fingers and then slowly and somewhat teasingly runs her tongue along it. Afterwards she says nothing, just quirks an eyebrow and gives you a decidedly pointed look.)~
@4398 = ~(As you raise her hand to your lips, she giggles in an almost endearing way, and cuffs you playfully.) What do we have here? Prince Charming, no less!~
@4399 = ~(She then moves closer to you and whispers in your ear.) But surely there are much sweeter things to kiss than my hand...~
@4400 = ~(She self-consciously touches her face.) What? Is something wrong with my face? Why are you looking at me like that?~
@4401 = ~No! Nothing is wrong with your face. I didn't realise I was staring. Sorry.~
@4402 = ~There's nothing wrong with your face, although you do have something on your cheek. (Move closer to her and make a show of brushing something from her cheek) There. All gone now.~
@4403 = ~(She gives you a rather curious look.) It's alright, <CHARNAME>. I don't mind. You were just... never mind. It's unimportant. (She smiles awkwardly.)~
@4404 = ~(She smiles back and touches her cheek. You notice a slight flush has suffused her face.) Thank you, <CHARNAME>. What would I do without you, hmm?~
@4405 = ~(You watch Fade as she walks along next to you. She is rummaging in her pack and you are vaguely aware that she is talking to you, but you're not really concentrating. All of a sudden, she asks you a question that captures your immediate attention.)~
@4406 = ~... well, <CHARNAME>? I won't ask you again. Are you a leg or a breast man?~
@4407 = ~W-what? Why are you asking me that?~
@4408 = ~(smirk) Why...  most definitely a leg man, Fade, although breasts do hold their own unique fascination for me too.~
@4409 = ~(Eye her cleavage) Breast man, no doubt about it.~
@4410 = ~(She looks a bit surprised.) Why ever not? I prefer the breast, personally, but I know some people like the leg more. I just wanted to know which bit you preferred.~
@4411 = ~Y-you like breasts more? Really?~
@4412 = ~(smirk) Why...  I most definitely like a bit of leg, Fade, although breasts do hold their own unique fascination for me too.~
@4413 = ~(Eye her cleavage) Breasts, no doubt about it... ~
@4414 = ~(She gives you a decidedly cynical look.) I'm actually talking about the left over chicken from last night, <CHARNAME>.~
@4415 = ~Oh! I'm, errr, sorry, Fade. I didn't realize... ~
@4416 = ~(grin) Really? I'm not.~
@4417 = ~Well, in that case, I do enjoy a bit of breast now and again.~
@4418 = ~Like I always say, you can't beat chewing on a bird's thigh.~
@4419 = ~(She sighs and rolls her eyes.) I knew you weren't listening to me. I'm talking about *lunch*, <CHARNAME>! We're having the chicken left over from last night.~
@4420 = ~(grin) Are we? I wasn't referring to chicken.~
@4421 = ~Well, yes, I know the meat is a bit drier, but I prefer that, there's less gristle... ~
@4422 = ~(She eyes you suspiciously.) You do realize that I'm talking about lunch, don't you, <CHARNAME>? We're having the chicken left over from last night.~
@4423 = ~Oh, err, are you? I'm sorry, I didn't realize... ~
@4424 = ~(smirk) No kidding.~
@4425 = ~(She purses her lips and tries to give you a disapproving look.) Really? I would never have guessed.~
@4426 = ~I'm sure you do...  and I bet you like to give it a good chewing while you're at it, don't you?~
@4427 = ~The chicken, that is, of course. (She quirks an eyebrow at you and smirks.)~
@4428 = ~Yes...  it helps to soften everything up first, doesn't it, <CHARNAME>? (She quirks an eyebrow at you and smirks.)~
@4429 = ~It isn't my "real" name, if that's what you mean. My given name is Kher'tal...  but that name belongs to a different person--a different time. I prefer Fade now.~
@4430 = ~So you don't want me to call you Kher'tal?~
@4431 = ~How ever did you pick up a name like Fade?~
@4432 = ~Well, you can if you like, but I doubt I'd answer you. I'm used to Fade now. Kher'tal was a very cruel, sadistic creature, and Fade would rather forget her.~
@4433 = ~(shrug) When I was younger, I was good with illusion spells. I was sometimes referred to as "The Fade" by the other Fey'ri. And now I'm a sneak...  it seemed appropriate. I prefer it. Kher'tal was a very cruel, sadistic creature, and Fade would rather forget her.~
@4434 = ~I... see, <CHARNAME>. Well, at least you're honest--and now I know.~
@4435 = ~(Kiss Fade)~
@4436 = ~(Cuddle Fade)~
@4437 = ~Hey, Fade, check me out! (Flex your muscles, lick your finger and press it against your buttocks) Tss! I'm hot, baby, DAMN hot!~
@4438 = ~Fade... do you love me?~
@4439 = ~Fade, you're hurt! Let me take a look at you.~
@4440 = ~I love you, Fade.~
@4441 = ~Fade, get that pretty little arse of yours over here NOW!!~
@4442 = ~Hey there, honeykitten.~
@4443 = ~(Lightly trace one of her facial tattoos with a finger)~
@4444 = ~(Poke your tongue out at Fade)~
@4445 = ~Fade, I'm going to make love to you tonight, hope you don't have any other plans.~
@4446 = ~(Brush her hair aside and kiss the nape of her neck)~
@4447 = ~Uh, Fade, I've got something for you.~
@4448 = ~(She accepts your kiss eagerly, and when you eventually break apart, her eyes are bright and her breathing is rather ragged.) <CHARNAME>... you really are going to have to stop winding me up like this--it is *most* unfair!~
@4449 = ~(Fade tilts her face as if to accept your kiss, but at the last moment, with a mischievous grin and a twinkle in her crimson eye, she darts forward and nibbles the end of your nose.)~
@4450 = ~(As you place your arms around her, she sighs contentedly and nestles herself against you.)~
@4451 = ~(She returns your embrace, but then pushes away from you, gazing deeply into your eyes. She then steps forward and gently kisses you.)~
@4452 = ~(She buries her face in her hands, laughing.) What are you like?!? Yes, sweetie, you are very hot, but you're drawing a crowd and although I am quite possibly the Mistress of Making a Fool of Yourself, you sure are doing a good impression of being the Master!~
@4453 = ~(She darts forward and grabs your buttocks in both hands, giving them a good squeeze. Then with a decidedly wicked grin, she gives you a ringing slap on the rump.)~
@4454 = ~(She gives you a rascally grin and turns away from you.) You think *that's* hot?~
@4455 = ~(She turns around and quickly flashes her breasts at you.) How about these puppies??~
@4456 = ~What kind of question is that to ask? Of course I do, <CHARNAME>... more and more every day we are together.~
@4457 = ~(She shivers and closes her eyes.) <CHARNAME>...~
@4458 = ~As you reach for the tiny gap in her armour and scratch at the sensitive scales at the base of her tail, she shivers and then pulls away from you slightly, her eyes dark. When she speaks, her voice has a low, growling quality to it.) I hope you're going to back that up, <CHARNAME>.~
@4459 = ~(Keep rubbing the scales and kiss her neck)~
@4460 = ~(Stop rubbing her scales) Just a taste of what I've got in mind for later...~
@4461 = ~(Her eyes roll back slightly and a grimace of pleasure crosses her face. She arches her back slightly, squirming under your touch, uttering strange growling noises. After a few moments, her eyes re-focus and she literally launches herself at you, knocking you to the ground.)~
@4462 = ~(chuckle) Fade, control yourself!~
@4463 = ~(grin) Ahhh... works every time!~
@4464 = ~(She initially snorts with indignation that you've stopped, but then grins back at you.) Then I look forward to this evening with bated breath...~
@4465 = ~(She sits up, straddling you, and treats you to a feral smile as she begins to unbuckle her armour.) No. You started it, so you're going to finish me... I mean it.~
@4466 = ~(She sits up, straddling you, and winks, grinning wolfishly.) I'm nothing if not predictable, <CHARNAME>...~
@4467 = ~(Fade grins at your offer.) Bless you, <CHARNAME>, but if you want to touch me, you don't have to make excuses anymore!~
@4468 = ~It's only a scratch--I'll be fine. You've got better things to be concerned about besides me right now. (smile)~
@4469 = ~(She smiles hesitantly and nods.) I didn't want to worry you, but it does smart a bit. Thank you, my love, for your concern.~
@4470 = ~<CHARNAME>... please, do something! I... I don't want to leave you this way!~
@4471 = ~And I love you too... more than you can imagine.~
@4472 = ~(smile) What brought that on?~
@4473 = ~(blush) Nothing.~
@4474 = ~(grin) Do I need an excuse?~
@4475 = ~Oh, you're too sweet! (She grins and leans over to kiss your cheek.)~
@4476 = ~Of course not, <CHARNAME>... and neither do I. I love you too.~
@4477 = ~(Grinning stupidly she shakes her head, turns around and with a flick of her tail, wiggles her backside at you. Giggling wildly, she then runs off.)~
@4478 = ~(She smirks salaciously and offers you a rather insolent mock-salute.) Yes SIR!!~
@4479 = ~(groan) Why do you insist on calling me that? Surely there are better pet names you could call me?~
@4480 = ~(grin) I take it by your calling me that dreadful nickname, I get to give you one too? How about... Snugglebunny? Or Wuggykins? Or even Schnookumdumpling? (She pauses and then gives you a sly look.) Or Babyplums...~
@4481 = ~Stop, stop! Have mercy! Okay, I give up--those are terrible names!~
@4482 = ~Oi! Who are you calling Babyplums? Cheeky wench!~
@4483 = ~You give up? Aww, that's a shame... I was just getting started. Does this mean I no longer have to suffer the indignity of being a part-demon with a pet-name like honeykitten?~
@4484 = ~(grin slyly) What do you think?~
@4485 = ~(sigh) I thought as such. I'm never going to live this down, you know...~
@4486 = ~Oh, has de big nasty tiefwing hurt oo's macho feelings? Does he need to have macho feelings kissed better?~
@4487 = ~(grin) Well, now you mention it...~
@4488 = ~Of all the women in the world, I end up with a tiefling with a cruel sense of humour! What did I do to deserve that?~
@4489 = ~(She purses her lips in mock-admonishment.) That's NOT what I meant, <CHARNAME>, and you know it! Dreadful creature...~
@4490 = ~(She tries to remain stern, but it is obvious by the way she is biting the insides of her cheeks that she is trying not to laugh. After a short while, however, it becomes too much for her and her strict façade melts into a rather knowing smirk.) Well, okay, maybe later...~
@4491 = ~(She grins winsomely and bats her eyelashes at you, but says nothing.)~
@4492 = ~(At first she looks bashful and tries to pull away from you, but when you don't release her, she leans forward and wraps her arms around your neck.)~
@4493 = ~What are you doing?~
@4494 = ~I've always wanted to do this, that's all. Your tattoos follow the contours of your face so well.~
@4495 = ~I know I said I didn't like them, but they have grown on me. They really do accentuate your face.~
@4496 = ~(She bites her bottom lip, blushes slightly and looks away.) No they don't... they're just silly. But it's... kind of you to say so.~
@4497 = ~(She bites her bottom lip, blushes slightly and looks away.) So you don't want me to get rid of them after all?~
@4498 = ~(smile) And no, they don't accentuate anything... they're just silly. But it's... kind of you to say so.~
@4499 = ~Now, rather than poking that thing out at me, why don't you come over here and put it to *real* use?~
@4500 = ~(Fade grins and, rather than poking hers back out at you, she just licks her lips.)~
@4501 = ~(grin) Well, I was going to wash my hair... but I know a better offer when one comes along!~
@4502 = ~(She smiles rather lasciviously.) Tonight? Why wait until then?~
@4503 = ~(She smiles and winks back, obviously delighting in the little secret exchange of feelings the two of you share.)~
@4504 = ~(giggles) Stop it... that tickles!~
@4505 = ~(She shivers and closes her eyes.) You know... that could replace my "tail" thing, <CHARNAME>. But there again, you could touch me anywhere and still get the same response...~
@4506 = ~Truly? A present? How sweet of you!~
@4507 = ~(grin) I'm absolutely positive you're going to love it. I know I will!~
@4508 = ~That's okay... although you may change your mind once you've seen what it is.~
@4509 = ~I didn't say it was a present, as such... just something I would, err, like you to have.~
@4510 = ~(blush) Look, on second thought, maybe this isn't such a good idea.~
@4511 = ~Oh, really? Well, I'll be the judge of that. Dare I ask what it is?~
@4512 = ~Here you go. Go on, honeykitten, try it on for size--just for me!~
@4513 = ~It's something rare and expensive, and I never thought I'd find one! Here you go, Fade.~
@4514 = ~Don't look like that, Fade--it's nothing to be worried about! Just, you know, a little fantasy of mine...~
@4515 = ~And why would I do that?~
@4516 = ~It... It's nothing horrible, is it? You know, like dried sea cucumbers or something?~
@4517 = ~Dried... sea cucumbers? (gulp) No, nothing like that! Dare I ask why that should worry you?~
@4518 = ~No, nothing horrible like that. Just, you know, a little something... oh, don't look like that! You know I wouldn't ask you to do anything really nasty.~
@4519 = ~Of course not! It's something rare and expensive, and I never thought I'd find one! Here you go, Fade.~
@4520 = ~Something to have? Ohh, I'm intrigued now. Come on, don't keep me in suspense! What is it?~
@4521 = ~It's, umm... something for you to wear...~
@4522 = ~(smile) Why are you blushing? What's not such a good idea? Come on, <CHARNAME>, you know you can tell me anything!~
@4523 = ~I don't think I can tell you. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now I'm not so sure. You're going to think I'm some kind of weirdo...~
@4524 = ~Okay, since you asked... I, err, bought it fr you.~
@4525 = ~No, this was a bad idea. Maybe later, okay?~
@4526 = ~(She holds up the bikini, gives it a long look, purses her lips at you and raises an eyebrow at you.) I see. Nothing says "I love you" more than giving your girlfriend something totally inappropriate that makes her feel like a complete tit, does it, <CHARNAME>?~
@4527 = ~Fade, don't be like that! It's only, you know, just for a bit of fun.~
@4528 = ~Are you going to try it on or what? Come on, Fade, you'd look fantastic in that!~
@4529 = ~Fade, you know I'm all for strong women, and I totally believe that women are as good as men at doing anything, and that there is a place in this world for them as fighters and blacksmiths as well as mothers and seamstresses, and that if I wasn't male, I would indeed be a feminist... but there are just some things that all men like, and seeing curvy female flesh in itty-bitty scraps of chain mail is one of them! (smile winningly) Uh, please? I'll do anything for you in return--you know that!~
@4530 = ~It's... a chain mail bikini. You spent hard-earned gold and bought me a chain mail bikini. After years and years of women trying to shake off the whole "barely-there armour" stereotype, you buy me this.~
@4531 = ~(sigh) And exactly *when* do you expect me to wear this?~
@4532 = ~Uh, now?~
@4533 = ~When you're ready. You know, anticipation makes everything so much sweeter...~
@4534 = ~Come on, Fade, it's just a silly fantasy. I don't expect you to wear it all the time--just, uh, you know, occasionally...~
@4535 = ~A fantasy? It's nothing nasty, is it? You know, involving dried sea cucumbers or something, because I do have some shred of pride, you know.~
@4536 = ~Err, no reason. Just that there are some chaps out there with some... very odd ideas about what is desirable and what isn't.~
@4537 = ~(She coughs and looks furtively around herself for a while before looking guardedly at you again.) Well, what is it, then?~
@4538 = ~You didn't? Not with... ewww! How could you? That's really, really nasty, Fade!~
@4539 = ~Whoa... and there's me worried about giving you this! Here you go--although I'm game for a bit of weird-ness if you are.~
@4540 = ~Err... yes... quickly changing the subject... Here you go! Go on, honeykitten.... Try it on for size--just for me!~
@4541 = ~You're male, aren't you? In my experience, all of you have a least one little peculiar quirk. (sigh) Go on, then, what is it?~
@4542 = ~To wear? Well, that's not too bad... I hope. Come on, <CHARNAME>, hand it over!~
@4543 = ~(say nothing, just hand over the bikini)~
@4544 = ~Okay, here you go! Go on, try it on for size!~
@4545 = ~Believe me, I don't think there's anything you could do or suggest that would make me think you're some kind of weirdo, especially when you're blushing like that! Come on, I'm a woman of the world! I expect I've seen worse.~
@4546 = ~(say nothing and hand over the bikini)~
@4547 = ~No, I really don't think so... I really think this should wait until later.~
@4548 = ~So when exactly do you expect me to wear this?~
@4549 = ~Please don't be like that. It's only, you know, just for a bit of fun.~
@4550 = ~Well, okay... if that's how you want to play it. (smile)~
@4551 = ~(She gives you a decidedly hard stare and then looks away for a second. Despite herself, you notice that she is trying not to smile.)~
@4552 = ~(sidle up to her and put your arms around her) Go on... just for me? I'll do anything for you, all you have to do is ask.~
@4553 = ~(grin) I know that smile--you're enjoying this as much as I am! Can I take that as a yes?~
@4554 = ~Anything? Anything at all? (She offers you a rather self-satisfied smile.) Okay, <CHARNAME>, if that's the case... I'll wear your little "gift" for you, next time we rest. That gives me time to think what I want in return.~
@4555 = ~(She grins rather wickedly and stuffs the bikini into her pack.)~
@4556 = ~NO!~
@4557 = ~(She tries to look sternly at you, but fails miserably; despite herself, she begins to laugh.) You really are a most dreadful, dreadful person!~
@4558 = ~Right... I know I may live to regret this, but okay, I'll wear your little "gift" for you next time we rest, but only if it's convenient! I'm not having half of Amn knowing what we're up to.~
@4559 = ~(She raises both her eyebrows at you and grins back.) Really? Well, maybe I shouldn't tell you when I plan to wear this for you...~
@4560 = ~Occasionally, huh? Just a little fantasy? (She quirks an eyebrow at you and a slight smile touches her lips.) I honestly didn't know you had it in you, <CHARNAME>... you filthy little thing!~
@4561 = ~Fair enough--I know I may live to regret this, but okay, I'll wear your little "gift" for you next time we rest, but only if it's convenient! I'm not having half of Amn knowing what we're up to.~
@4562 = ~No, I didn't... It was just... Look, it doesn't matter! What is it you want to give me? And if you say "one", I'm going to get angry, understood?~
@4563 = ~Yeessss... Okay, I understand. Umm, maybe this should wait...~
@4564 = ~Okay, I take your point. Here you go, then! Go on, honeykitten. Try it on for size--just for me!~
@4565 = ~Perfectly. It's something rare and expensive... and I never thought I'd find one! Here you go, Fade.~
@4566 = ~Yes, I understand. It's, umm... something for you to wear...~
@4567 = ~(She narrows her eyes at you.) Don't make me hurt you, <CHARNAME>.~
@4568 = ~(She holds up the bikini, gives it a long look, purses her lips at you and raises an eyebrow at you.) I see. Okay, it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but I will say you're not doing much for the cause of the female adventurer.~
@4569 = ~Women have been trying to shake off the whole "barely-there armour" stereotype for years and years! And now, here you are, handing me the archetypal... item... that we've been trying to avoid. You're seriously asking me to wear *this*?~
@4570 = ~(mumble) Please don't be like that. This is hard enough for me as it is... it's only, you know, just for a bit of fun...~
@4571 = ~(She taps her foot on the ground, looking impatient.) Oh no, you're not getting out of this so easily. What is it?~
@4572 = ~Okay, okay, fair enough--here you go! Go on, honeykitten, try it on for size--just for me!~
@4573 = ~Uh, no, really, I think it should wait... I'll give it to you later!~
@4574 = ~(She rolls her eyes at you and sighs rather dramatically.) Okay, you can take that as a "Yes".~
@4575 = ~(She then grins and shakes a finger at you in mock admonishment.) I really do have to start trying to resist you! I know I may live to regret this, but okay, I'll wear your little "gift" next time we rest, but only if it's convenient! I'm not having half of Amn knowing what we're up to.~
@4576 = ~(sigh) Yes... I know. (To your surprise, she smiles at you rather slyly.) And, truth be told, I am quite flattered.~
@4577 = ~I know I may live to regret this, but okay, I'll wear your little "gift" next time we rest, but only if it's convenient! I'm not having half of Amn knowing what we're up to.~
@4578 = ~Fade? After all these years... do my eyes deceive me?~
@4579 = ~Keita? K-Keita!? What are you doing here? You... you *can't* be here! You... died...~
@4580 = ~I died because you abandoned me... you left me for the guards. Why did you abandon me? I thought we were like sisters! Closer, even... two kindred spirits, you once said...~
@4581 = ~Keita, no!  I didn't abandon you! I... I wanted to go back for you, but they wouldn't let me! I was knocked out... Brennan took me home before they could capture me as well. When I awoke... I tried! I really did! Keita, please believe me!~
@4582 = ~You promised you would never let them hurt me again, Fade. I trusted you. I believed you. When they surrounded me...~
@4583 = ~Keita... please! I was told you turned the knife on yourself. I do not need to hear it again...~
@4584 = ~... when they surrounded me, I did indeed turn the knife on myself... but it was not enough to end my life. Over and over again I was beaten and abused, until the day came when I realised you had left me. You had your freedom, and you were never coming to rescue me... you had forgotten me. That is what killed me.~
@4585 = ~No! NO!! That never happened! I *never* forgot you, Keita, ever! If I had known you had survived, I would never have abandoned you, ever!~
@4586 = ~Keita... I loved you! (sob) Every day, I think of you! Why are you being so cruel? The Keita I knew would never have been this cruel! Just stop!~
@4587 = ~Keita! Stop this at once! Fade is not to be blamed for what happened to you!~
@4588 = ~Stop, Gorion!  She doesn't deserve this!~
@4589 = ~Enough!  I won't allow this to continue!~
@4590 = ~Don't you believe it, Fade! It's a lie!~
@4591 = ~What of the inevitable pain you must give to the one you love? The fiendling you name 'Fade'.~
@4592 = ~Pain? You don't know what you're talking about! <CHARNAME> has brought me happiness, not pain!~
@4593 = ~'Tis a beautiful specimen, is it not? Are you buying it for yourself, or for someone special?~
@4594 = ~Not that it's any of your business... but it's for someone else.~
@4595 = ~It's for someone very special. I've been looking for something suitable for her for a while, and I think this is it.~
@4596 = ~What's it to you? You've got your gold--now stop prying!~
@4597 = ~Is there a way I can possibly get this engraved?~
@4598 = ~I am sorry... and you are right, it is none of my business. It is just that most people... most men... buy such rings as presents for a beau since it has no other use, other than a pretty bauble. I hope they like it, whoever the recipient is.~
@4599 = ~Ahh... forgive my snappish comment. The ring is indeed for someone special. I've been looking for something suitable for her for a while, and I think this is it.~
@4600 = ~So do I.~
@4601 = ~What's wrong with you? I said it was none of your business! You've got your gold--now stop prying.~
@4602 = ~I do too. Do you know of any way I can possibly get this engraved?~
@4603 = ~I see. I am sure she will be suitably pleased. It isn't every day that someone buys such a trinket for you, is it?~
@4604 = ~No, it isn't. But she's worth it.~
@4605 = ~No, it isn't... but this is no ordinary ring. It... it is to be an engagement ring. I just hope she accepts it.~
@4606 = ~Do you know of any way I can possibly get this engraved?~
@4607 = ~I am sorry. I hope you enjoy your purchase.~
@4608 = ~Engraved? Hmmm... I don't know, I am no jeweller. You could try Kerrick--he's always tinkering with metals. But he's more of a smith, so such detailed work may be beyond him. However, he may know of someone who can help.~
@4609 = ~(sigh) I am sure they will. Good day.~
@4610 = ~I am sure she is. Can I ask who the lucky lady is?~
@4611 = ~(point surreptitiously at Fade.) That's her.~
@4612 = ~(grin) She's the red head with the tail. The stone matches the colour of her eyes. That's why I knew it was perfect.~
@4613 = ~She is one of my travelling companions...~
@4614 = ~Well, it is a magnificent gift. I am sure she will accept it... and what you offer her. (smile) I wish you the best of luck.~
@4615 = ~Indeed? I see she has a tail. That is... most unusual. Well, I wish you luck and long life, in all your endeavours.~
@4616 = ~It matches her... eyes? How wonderful! I, err, wouldn't have guessed that was the reason why you purchased it. Still, good luck and long life.~
@4617 = ~Ahhh, so you know her well. That is a good basis. Good luck and long life to you, then!~
@4618 = ~Yes, can I help you?~
@4619 = ~Yes. I wonder if you could work on enlarging this armour for my girlfriend. She's pregnant, you see, and it's getting a little tight.~
@4620 = ~Fade... do you want to tell him?~
@4621 = ~Uh, this is a bit of an odd request, but... can you enlarge some armour for me?~
@4622 = ~Fine... fine... no need to get nasty. It'll cost you 500 gold. Up front, mind you, but it won't take too long. You're welcome to wait.~
@4623 = ~Yes, of course I can... but there's no need to be rude! It'll cost you 500 gold. Up front, mind you, but it won't take too long. You're welcome to wait.~
@4624 = ~Oh, 'tis you again. Just to let you know, I'm not doing any more adjustments on that woman's armour! I'm sure she has a wyvern's barb rather than a tongue... such vitriol! Never thought I'd hear a mother-to-be swear *quite* like that.~
@4625 = ~Well, you did sew up the hole she uses for her tail! She spent ages trying to get it in the right place so it didn't chafe her.~
@4626 = ~No, no, she doesn't need her armour adjusted. I just wondered if you would do some engraving for me. I know it's a bit of an odd request, but I have no idea who else to ask!~
@4627 = ~I'd be very careful of what you say... that's the mother of my child you're referring too!~
@4628 = ~(grin) Yeah... she's a little firebrand when she gets going, isn't she?~
@4629 = ~Yeah, well, I thought it looked a little rough around the edges. How was I supposed to know she'd fixed it herself! I mean, what normal woman goes around with a tail anyway? No offence, of course, considering your attachment to her, but...~
@4630 = ~No offence? You're insulting the mother of my child!~
@4631 = ~Look, I'm not here to discuss Fade, or her armour. I just wondered if you would do some engraving for me. I know it's a bit of an odd request, but I have no idea who else to ask!~
@4632 = ~Engraving, huh? Not a part of my usual line of work, but I suppose I could look into it. It won't be cheap, though. What do you want done?~
@4633 = ~I see. How much do you reckon it's going to cost?~
@4634 = ~It's this ring. I want it to say 'Dearest Fade, With Love Forever, <CHARNAME>' on the inside.~
@4635 = ~It's this ring. I want 'Yours always and forever, <CHARNAME>' written on the inside of it.~
@4636 = ~Ahhh, forget it. Stupid idea anyway.~
@4637 = ~(mutter) Heh, it takes all kinds. Please, tell me what you want or leave me be.~
@4638 = ~Okay, I just wondered if you would do some engraving for me. I know it's a bit of an odd request, but I have no idea who else to ask!~
@4639 = ~Ahhh, forget it. See you later.~
@4640 = ~She threatened to cut my nose off and make it into a purse! And, being a gnome, that's a serious threat indeed! Please, tell me what you want or leave me be.~
@4641 = ~Uhh, well, I'm sorry about that. She wouldn't have done it, honestly! I just wondered if you would do some engraving for me. I know it's a bit of an odd request, but I have no idea who else to ask!~
@4642 = ~Well, I don't know. You have to tell me what you want engraved first.~
@4643 = ~Don't you cheek me now, gnome. I want a ring engraved, simple as that.~
@4644 = ~You want that tiny thing engraved?! (sigh) Okay, I'll give it a go. I've worked etching tiny cogs... a few words on the inside of a ring shouldn't be too hard. I'll cost you 2000gp, though. I warned you it would be expensive.~
@4645 = ~Expensive?! That's extortion! The ring cost me the earth... just forget it. See you later.~
@4646 = ~Expense is not the issue here--here's 2000gp. How long will it take?~
@4647 = ~Whoa, I'm not leaving you with the ring! That thing cost me a fortune! I'll pay you your 2000gp, but I'm staying here while you do it.~
@4648 = ~Up to you. Good day.~
@4649 = ~(sigh) Okay... a ring. Well, it depends what you want engraved on it, too. Or is that too cheeky a question for you?~
@4650 = ~Oh, forget this. See you later.~
@4651 = ~Hmmm... about a day. Some back in 24 hours--it should be ready then. As a gesture of goodwill, you can pay me on completion.~
@4652 = ~Fine, I will return in 24 hours, and I will pay you then. Nice doing business with you again!~
@4653 = ~Whoa, you know that ring is worth a lot more than 2000gp. I'm not leaving you with it--I'm staying right here while you do it.~
@4654 = ~Oh, for the love of... okay! Stay here, if that's what you want. I don't have a seat for you, nor a bed. You'd better tell your companions you're going to be indisposed for a while. I'm not having *all* of them stay here, you know.~
@4655 = ~Fair enough. I'll see you in a day, then.~
@4656 = ~Engraving? Whoever told you I might be able to do that for you, I wonder! It's not a part of my usual line of work, but I suppose I could look into it.~
@4657 = ~It won't be cheap, though. What do you want done?~
@4658 = ~Here, it is ready. 2000gp please, as we agreed.~
@4659 = ~Lovely work. Thank you.~
@4660 = ~2000gp? I'm sure you said 200gp yesterday.~
@4661 = ~2000gp for such shoddy work? You have to be kidding. You'll get 1000, and not a copper more.~
@4662 = ~I'm sorry, but I can't afford to pay you at the moment.~
@4663 = ~Nice working for you. Now if only I can remedy this extreme case of eyestrain I have got...~
@4664 = ~I suppose you think I was born yesterday, huh? You pay me 2000gp, or I keep it.~
@4665 = ~Okay, okay, here's 2000gp.~
@4666 = ~Tightwad gnome! Now you pay!~
@4667 = ~Oh? Did I? Doesn't sound lie something I'd say... but I trust you. Okay, 200 gp it is. Nice working for you. Now if only I can remedy this extreme case of eyestrain I have got...~
@4668 = ~I think not! I've worked hard--it's 2000gp or nothing!~
@4669 = ~Oh, is that so? Well... come back when you can, then.~
@4670 = ~She's pregnant and still fighting? I knew you adventuring types were committed, but I never thought I'd see a pregnant lass come in here asking for new armour. Surely she needs rest? An easy life?~
@4671 = ~I'm not *that* far gone, you know. Nor am I sick and fragile! I just need a bit more space to, err, grow into. Can you do it or not?~
@4672 = ~Well, of course I can do it... By the Gods, What *is* that? Do you have a tail? Just... just what is going on here?!~
@4673 = ~Yes, she has a tail. That shouldn't make any difference to you--my gold is as good as anyone's. Can you do it?~
@4674 = ~Nothing that is any of your business. Can you do it or not?~
@4675 = ~Fade is a tiefling, simple as that. Do you know what a tiefling is?~
@4676 = ~Aye, that I can, but that's not an odd request. What's odd about it?~
@4677 = ~It's odd because it's for me. I'm pregnant, and my armour is getting a little tight. Can you do it?~
@4678 = ~No, I don't know hat a tiefling is. I take it that it's something bad, though.~
@4679 = ~That depends on your point of view. A tiefling is someone who has a demonic ancestor.~
@4680 = ~D-demonic? And you're *pregnant*?~
@4681 = ~Yes, she is! And it's my child she's carrying, before you think about saying anything further!~
@4682 = ~Look, stop the prejudice and give me a straight answer. Are you willing to accept my gold or not?~
@4683 = ~*Your* child? You... you are willing to bring a little life into this world with a *demon*?~
@4684 = ~(sigh) Get it right, at least. Demon *spawn*. Not a full demon. And before my love here does something he later regrets, even if it is simply because I'll complain and nag him because he slaughtered you where you stood for insulting me *before* you fixed my now rather uncomfortably tight armour, will you please just enlarge it? Just a little?~
@4685 = ~(gulp) O-okay. I'll accept your commission. It'll cost you 500 gold. Up front,  mind you, but it won't take too long. You're welcome to wait.~
@4686 = ~(sigh) Okay. Mr. Armourer, I am currently pregnant, and I need to get my armour enlarged. Can you do it?~
@4687 = ~Thank you, Kerrick.~
@4688 = ~I have a bit of an odd request, but I was told you may be able to help me. I just wondered if you would do some engraving for me.~
@4689 = ~I'd like to pick up that ring now.~
@4690 = ~Oooohhhh! Pretty, sparkly ring! Is special ring? I cans make it specialer, if you like.~
@4691 = ~If you brings Chaotic Commands protection scroll, two diamonds, and Soulfire Gem, Cespenar can attempts to make Soulfire Ring.~
@4692 = ~Okay, go ahead. Make the Soulfire Ring.~
@4693 = ~No, just leave it for now. Maybe later.~
@4694 = ~Okay. If you changes mind, Cespenar can still make it.~
@4695 = ~You wants Cespenar to make you other shiny ones, maybe?~
@4696 = ~Is that *it*? Make your choice? Do you have any idea what you are asking of him?! How in the entire Abyss is he supposed to make a snap decision like that? Give up everything you have or... or become a *god*?!~
@4697 = ~Fade, calm down. This is not as hard a decision as you would think.~
@4698 = ~What do you think I should do, Fade? What would you do in my position? Should I give up the essence?~
@4699 = ~The decision is not hard. I'm sorry, my love, but feel I have to go forward and accept my birthright.~
@4700 = ~I... it isn't?~
@4701 = ~I suppose not--not for you. From the beginning you were destined for great things; I saw that straight away.~
@4702 = ~Go on then! Throw away everything we have built together! Accept the essence!~
@4703 = ~Is that what you would do, given the choice? Is that your advice?~
@4704 = ~Fade, my love... this is my birthright. I feel that I have to go forward and accept it.~
@4705 = ~But what if I don't want it? What if I want to stay here with you? I don't want to lose you! I want to see our baby grow!~
@4706 = ~But what if I don't want it? What if I want to stay here with you? I don't want to lose you!~
@4707 = ~Why ask me? It's ultimately your choice.~
@4708 = ~Fade, please be honest with me. What would you do given the choice? What would you advise?~
@4709 = ~Yes, it is my choice. But you're a huge part of my life and I think that gives you the right to hep me make that decision, don't you?~
@4710 = ~Very true. I'm sorry, my love, but feel I have to go forward and accept my birthright.~
@4711 = ~Please don't be like this, not now. I love you! I don't want us to be apart! I want to see our baby grow!~
@4712 = ~Please don't be like this, not now. I love you! I don't want us to be apart!~
@4713 = ~So what? My birthright is to be an evil, murdering bitch! <CHARNAME>, I know this is selfish of me and that the choice is ultimately yours, but I don't want to lose you! You've taught me so much... changed me so much. I've learnt to trust... to love...~
@4714 = ~For the love of the gods, I'm the mother of your unborn child!! Have you even considered that? That your child will grow up not knowing its own father?~
@4715 = ~Go on then! Throw away everything we have built together! Throw away our love! Accept the essence!~
@4716 = ~Fade, please don't be like this! Not now!~
@4717 = ~You're strong, Fade. And think of all I could do for you if I accept my godhood... maybe I could arrange for you to join me, somehow. Then we wouldn't be apart!~
@4718 = ~If I accept this chance, I could eradicate your demonic side! You could be free of your own taint, just as I am free of mine--imagine that! Isn't that what you've always wanted?~
@4719 = ~You can't guilt-trip me into making a decision, Fade. I have to make one I won't later regret--the last thing I want to do is end up resenting you.~
@4720 = ~Maybe, once upon a time, when power was all that I craved... but not now. <CHARNAME>, you've taught me so much... changed me so much. I've learnt to trust... to love...~
@4721 = ~I don't know what I will do if you leave, my love. I... I don't want you to go! I wish you could postpone this moment for an age, decide when we are old and our lives are all but spent; but no, you have to choose now...~
@4722 = ~Make your choice then, <CHARNAME>. It has to be yours and yours alone.~
@4723 = ~And I don't want to lose you either! But you have a chance to become a god--to join the ranks of the divine. If you stay with me, you will remain mortal; to wither and die once your time is up...~
@4724 = ~<CHARNAME>, you've taught me so much... changed me so much. I've learnt to trust... to love...~
@4725 = ~And I don't want to lose you either! I want you to be there for our child, to be the father I know you can and will be. But you have a chance to become a god - to join the ranks of the divine. If you stay with me, you will remain mortal; to wither and die once your time is up...~
@4726 = ~How can I be honest with you, <CHARNAME>? You *know* what my advice would be, as selfish as it is.~
@4727 = ~If you think I'm just going to send you on your way with a wave and a smile, you are sorely mistaken! For the love of the gods, I'm the mother of your unborn child!! Have you even considered that? That your child will grow up not knowing its own father? You've taught me so much... changed me so much. I've learnt to trust... to love...~
@4728 = ~If you think I'm just going to send you on your way with a wave and a smile, you are sorely mistaken! You've taught me so much... changed me so much. I've learnt to trust... to love...~
@4729 = ~Does it? Or will you end up resenting me? Or the child... our child... that grows within me? Are you truly willing to give up all that is being offered to you for such a comparatively silly thing as love?~
@4730 = ~Does it? Or will you end up resenting me? Are you truly willing to give up all that is being offered to you for such a comparatively silly thing as love?~
@4731 = ~How do you expect me to be? I don't want us to be apart--not ever! I want you to be there for our child, to be the father I know you can and will be. Yes, I realise that might be a little selfish, but if you think I'm just going to send you on your way with a wave and a smile, you are sorely mistaken!~
@4732 = ~But you have a chance to become a god--to join the ranks of the divine. If you stay with me, you will remain mortal; to wither and die once your time is up...~
@4733 = ~How do you expect me to be? I don't want us to be apart--not ever! Yes, I realise that might be a little selfish, but if you think I'm just going to send you on your way with a wave and a smile, you are sorely mistaken!~
@4734 = ~How do you expect me to be?! I can't pretend to be happy for you, <CHARNAME>, not when I'm this close to losing you forever!~
@4735 = ~For the love of the gods, I'm the mother of your unborn child!! Have you even considered that? That your child will grow up not knowing its own father? I want you to be here, to see your child grow!~
@4736 = ~Yes, I realise that might be a little selfish, but if you think I'm just going to send you on your way with a wave and a smile, you are sorely mistaken!~
@4737 = ~*Join* you? In the ranks of the divine? Don't make me laugh, <CHARNAME>--such trivial things would be an abuse of your new power. And how would our child fare? It doesn't have a choice!~
@4738 = ~Please... please don't go. I don't know what I will do if you leave! Just... just refuse. Stay with me!~
@4739 = ~I wish you could postpone this moment for an age, decide when we are old and our lives are all but spent; but no, you have to choose now. Make your choice then, <CHARNAME>. It has to be yours and yours alone.~
@4740 = ~*Join* you? In the ranks of the divine? Don't make me laugh, <CHARNAME>--such trivial things would be an abuse of your new power.~
@4741 = ~Getting rid of my demonic urges is a poor consolation for losing you, <CHARNAME>! Can't you see that? I am learning to cope with that facet of my personality--with your help. You've taught me so much... changed me so much. I've learnt to trust... to love...~
@4742 = ~I don't know what I will do if you leave, my love. I... I don't want you to go! I want you to be there for our child; to be the father I know you can and will be. I wish you could postpone this moment for an age, decide when we are old and our lives are all but spent; but no, you have to choose now...~
@4743 = ~Make your choice then, <CHARNAME>. It has to be yours and yours alone.~
@4744 = ~Guilty? GUILTY?!  If you think that is my agenda, maybe you should accept!~
@4745 = ~I don't want you to leave because I am the mother of your unborn child, and more importantly, I love you! Yes, I realise that might be a little selfish, but if you think I'm just going to send you on your way with a wave and a smile, you are sorely mistaken!~
@4746 = ~Please... please don't go. I don't know what I will do if you leave! Just... just refuse. Stay with me! You promised you'd always be there...~
@4747 = ~I wish you could postpone this moment for an age, decide when we are old and our lives are all but spent; but no, you have to choose now.~
@4748 = ~I don't want you to leave because I love you, <CHARNAME>! Yes, I realise that might be a little selfish, but if you think I'm just going to send you on your way with a wave and a smile, you are sorely mistaken!~
@4749 = ~NO! Don't leave me! Please don't go!~
@4750 = ~I've made my choice, Fade. I can't turn down such an opportunity as this. We will meet again--I promise!~
@4751 = ~Fade, I have been given the offer of ultimate power! How could I refuse? I will always remember what we had--I shall never, ever forget it--but I would be a fool to refuse such a gift! Please try to understand!~
@4752 = ~No... Fade... I can't... I want to change my decision! I don't want to leave her!~
@4753 = ~Please, Fade... this is hard enough already! I have been offered a great gift--possibly the greatest gift--how could I refuse? I will always remember what we had--I shall never, ever forget it--but I can do so much more now. Please try to understand!~
@4754 = ~Please... this is hard enough already, but it is for the greater good! I will always remember what we had--I shall never, ever forget it--but I can do so much more now. Please try to understand!~
@4755 = ~Somehow... somehow I very much doubt that. Just go. Go NOW! Don't make this harder!~
@4756 = ~Understand? UNDERSTAND?! The greatest gift a man could hope for is here, growing within me--a child! YOUR child! Just... go. Go NOW! Don't make this harder!~
@4757 = ~Understand? UNDERSTAND?! You're leaving me to pursue your visions of grandeur! Just go. Go NOW! Don't make this harder!~
@4758 = ~I am sorry, but your decision has been made, godchild, and that is final.~
@4759 = ~You... you're staying? You have chosen mortality over godhood... why?!~
@4760 = ~What do you mean, why? Why would I want to be a god? I want to stay here--to live as much of a normal life as I can... with you. If you're happy to have me, that is...~
@4761 = ~Because I want to remain here with you. Things might have been different if you weren't an issue... but you are. I love you, Fade, and I always will.~
@4762 = ~Because there are more important things in this world than our own destinies--like the destinies of our children. I made a promise to you that I would never leave you, or our child--and I meant it.~
@4763 = ~*If* I am happy to have you? <CHARNAME>, my love... I'm ecstatic! This is more than I could ever have hoped for. We can now move on and forge a real future together, one free of fear and uncertainty.~
@4764 = ~And I love you more than life itself. This is more than I could ever have hoped for. We can now move on and forge a real future together, one free of fear and uncertainty.~
@4765 = ~(Initially, Fade says nothing. She just places her hands on her belly and looks incredulously at you.) You... you gave it all up for your child? You have a chance to be a great and powerful being...~
@4766 = ~A hard choice... your victory is hard won indeed, and the prize seems one of infinite possibilities. Once I would have advised you to grab the opportunity with both hands, but as they say, "with great power comes great responsibility". A hard choice indeed.~
@4767 = ~Bloody cowards... why don't you pick on a woman with the ability to defend herself? Like me, for instance. Now, do you want to go one on one, or should I take both of you on at the same time?~
@4768 = ~<CHARNAME>?! You aren't just going to let them get away with this, are you? Well, even if you are, I'm certainly not...~
@4769 = ~Are you some kind of idiot, <CHARNAME>? Take that gold back and tear them a new arsehole! And if you don't want to, I'm more than willing!~
@4770 = ~Tell me about Fade.~
@4771 = ~Fade, the exotic tiefling rogue, devoted lover of <CHARNAME> and mistress of locks. No door or trap will hamper the success of her ambition, be it in the pursuit of riches or her many adversaries.~
@4772 = ~Fade, the exotic tiefling rogue, the mistress of locks. No door or trap will hamper the success of her ambition, be it in the pursuit of gold or her many adversaries.~
@4773 = ~Oh, will you stop your bloody whining! There's enough trouble out there without some 'fraidy-cat sodding dwarf wetting his bloody pants in here, trying to cover his fear with bravado!~
@4774 = ~*What* did ye jus' say, ye freakish excuse fer a pansy elf?~
@4775 = ~You heard me, dwarf!~
@4776 = ~Them's fightin' words, ye tailed weirdo!~
@4777 = ~Oh yeah?! Bring it on!~
@4778 = ~Fade! Stop picking fights and calm down!~
@4779 = ~Oh, for the love of... Fade, behave yourself!~
@4780 = ~Did you just call my girlfriend a weirdo?~
@4781 = ~Yeah?! You want to make something of it, Bhaalspawn? Well you can fuck off too!~
@4782 = ~You dare tell me to behave? You want to make something of it, Bhaalspawn? Well you can fuck off too!~
@4783 = ~Ooooh, you're in trouble now. You've just pissed off a Bhaalspawn--MY Bhaalspawn--probably the most powerful one in all the Realms...~
@4784 = ~There's a war going on out there and you're worried about a little bad language?! Reality check, <CHARNAME>!~
@4785 = ~People are dying out there... in their hundreds... through no fault of their own... you... you can see them, just lying in the street, their blood seeping into the cold stone...~
@4786 = ~(She shudders almost convulsively.) Excuse me, I have to get out of here...~
@4787 = ~Time for a time out?! Tell that to the war that's going on out there!~
@4788 = ~My *place*?! How dare you! I'll speak to you in whatever manner I want, you arrogant little prick!~
@4789 = ~Do you want to make something of it? Here? Now? Because I don't fear you OR any of your Bhaalspawn siblings!~
@4790 = ~Even with the war out there... with all the violence... people dying... in their hundreds... through no fault of their own... you... you can see them, just lying in the street, their blood seeping into the cold stone...~
@4791 = ~(She shudders almost convulsively and looks wildly around herself.) Excuse me, <CHARNAME>, I have to get out of here...~
@4792 = ~There's a war going on out there and you think *I'm* being theatrical?! It's the biggest theatre in the world out there!~
@4793 = ~Fade, there's no need to use such vile language!~
@4794 = ~Oooookkkaaaayyyy... time for a bit of a time out, don't you agree?~
@4795 = ~Fade, I swear to what ever god is listening that if you ever say that to me again, I will be forced to hurt you! Remember your place!~
@4796 = ~Oh, Fade, pack it in and calm down. The last thing we need are your theatrics in here.~
@4797 = ~That's right! Bloody cowards! Run off with your tails between your legs! What happened to the legendary bravery of the dwarves, eh?~
@4798 = ~Fade, you know I'm not going to allow you to wander around picking fights! What the hell is wrong with you? Just pack it in and calm down!~
@4799 = ~I swear to whatever god is listening that if you start picking fights like that again against simple bystanders, I will be forced to hurt you! Remember your place!~
@4800 = ~B-Bhaalspawn?~
@4801 = ~Yes, Bhaalspawn. Now I suggest that you walk away, join your friends and stop threatening my girl.~
@4802 = ~Oh, Fade, just shut up! I know you want to pick a fight with someone, but I'm not going to allow it, okay? So pack it in and calm down!~
@4803 = ~Okay, okay. Now doan' do nuthin' hasty... me and me mates're off now, Mr. Bhaalspawn sir...~
@4804 = ~Bring me Fade, the fey'ri thief.~
@4805 = ~Bring me Fade, my beloved fiendish Shadow Thief.~
@4806 = ~(Fade looks around with amusement, her tail twitches) ~
@4807 = ~Strange place. Maybe even *too* strange, for my taste. So--~
@4808 = ~I had a feeling you'd call for me sooner or later, <CHARNAME>. People like you are just *drawn* to trouble, and what am I if not trouble, hmm?~
@4809 = ~You got that right! (Laugh) Same ol' Fade.  You haven't changed a bit. Actually, did you do something new to your hair...?~
@4810 = ~You got that right! Perhaps *too* much trouble, actually. Maybe you could just...wait over there for a moment, ok?~
@4811 = ~Why, thank you for noticing! You're still the same ol' charmer that you always were. So...did you need my help or what?~
@4812 = ~I do.  Are you in?~
@4813 = ~You know what? I think I've made a mistake - stand over there for a while, hmm?~
@4814 = ~Of course I am!  Let's go.~
@4815 = ~Don't make me wait *too* long, <CHARNAME>.  I'm not exactly known for my patience, you know.~
@4816 = ~My, my, my, <CHARNAME>.  What *have* you been up to lately, hmmm?~
@4817 = ~I hope you haven't been getting into trouble while I wasn't around to keep an eye on you. Wait -- what am I saying?  You *always* get into trouble, with or without me.  I just prefer to be around to join the fun.~
@4818 = ~(Smile) That makes two of us, Fade.  I've missed you.  It's never quite the same without you.~
@4819 = ~Ehh, perhaps this isn't such a good idea after all.  I'd rather just have you wait right here where it's safe. ~
@4820 = ~(Blush) You're still the same ol' charmer that you always were. So...did you need me or what?~
@4821 = ~I do. I couldn't do this without you.  Actually, I probably could, but... it just wouldn't be the same.  Will you come with me?~
@4822 = ~You know, this might actually be more dangerous that I thought. I think you should just...wait over there for a moment, ok?~
@4823 = ~Of course I will! Someone has to keep you in one piece. Let's go.~
@4824 = ~Don't make me wait *too* long, <CHARNAME>. I'm not exactly known for my patience, you know.~
@4825 = ~You're back. So...did you need my help or what?~
@4826 = ~No, sorry, not yet.  Just wait a little while longer, okay?~
@4827 = ~Are you *sure* you want me to go?~
@4828 = ~No, stay.~
@4829 = ~Just wait for me here.  I won't be too long.~
@4830 = ~All right.~
@4831 = ~You want me to leave?  But...why??~
@4832 = ~Well...stay.~
@4833 = ~Just wait for me here, love.  I promise I won't be gone too long.~
@4834 = ~Humph! All right. I'll be waiting, but don't expect me to understand what you just did, huh?~
@4835 = ~(sigh) Another Bhaalspawn-hunter, I suppose?  Do you have *any* idea how old it gets after a while?~
@4836 = ~You travel with interesting companions, Bhaalspawn. I should make the mouthy redhead eat her words, but in the end, she doesn't matter. It's *your* head I'm after.~
@4837 = ~Well, this is turning into quite the family reunion, eh, <CHARNAME>?~
@4838 = ~ How about *you* back off now, and *you* won't get hurt?~
@4839 = ~Hmm, who indeed? I don't trust this guy, <CHARNAME>.  He has shifty eyes.~
@4840 = ~Well, today's your lucky day then.  We're here to get you out!~
@4841 = ~Uh-huh. And just how much did you pay these...*witnesses*?~
@4842 = ~I did no such thing--erm, I mean, you are mistaken, surely!~
@4843 = ~Aww, poor kid!  He's scared to death!~
@4844 = ~<CHARNAME>, we *have* to help him!  We can't just... leave him here like this!~
@4845 = ~You're right -- we *won't* let you live!~
@4846 = ~He didn't exactly give us a choice. First you tell us to stop him, and now that we have you tell us we made a mistake.  Just make up your mind, will you?~
@4847 = ~I had hoped you might find a...peaceful solution.~
@4848 = ~Your...boy?...I think my head just imploded...~
@4849 = ~Just when I thought things couldn't get much weirder...  I don't suppose we could just dump his heart in a bucket of cold water or have someone cast a Cone of Cold spell to stop him?  (sigh) I didn't think so.~
@4850 = ~What's this? That big...cowardly *pig* left this woman chained and alone, without any food or water?? No matter who she is, no one deserves to be treated like *that*! Free her, <CHARNAME>. We can't leave her like this.~
@4851 = ~<CHARNAME>! I said *free her*. She doesn't deserve this.~
@4852 = ~You know what? I don't give a damn what <CHARNAME> says.  I know how it feels to be chained up and abused like a mongrel dog, and I'm *not* about to let that happen to you, or anyone else, as long as *I* can help it.  And <CHARNAME>, if you have a problem with that, we're just going to have to deal with it later, understood?~
@4853 = ~Just don't move, woman. I need to take care of the manacles.~
@4854 = ~Ah... free at last. I suppose I am in your debt. Well, I will be beholden to no woman. Though it galls me, I will tell you what I know of Yaga-Shura.~
@4855 = ~My name is Ehlastra, a warrior from the Northern lands. I had heard legends of Yaga-Shura, a Child of Bhaal born unto a giantess. I came to this place to see if the legends were true.~
@4856 = ~And that part is true, as we can see.~
@4857 = ~Yes. However, the fire giants in this Temple are short-sighted fools. They recognized my warrior skills, but saw me only as a potential mate for Yaga-Shura, a chance for him to further spread Bhaal's seed.~
@4858 = ~I've met guys like them. They're no better than sewage.~
@4859 = ~But now they are dead, and I yet survive. My only regret is that I could not kill Yaga-Shura's followers with my own hands.~
@4860 = ~I have nothing more to say on this matter. But perhaps there's something more I can tell you...~
@4861 = ~We're all ears.~
@4862 = ~I have been here many months, and I have overheard bits and pieces of many conversations. I have heard mention of a name from Yaga-Shura's past: Nyalee, an old crone who lives in the marshes of the Mir Forests. She may know Yaga-Shura's secrets. And I also know Yaga-Shura is obsessed with a golden chest he keeps hidden beneath his bed. Unfortunately, this is the full extent of what I have been able to learn in my captivity.~
@4863 = ~That's more than enough. Go now. You're free.~
@4864 = ~I shall return to the North - the sulfur stench of these lands galls me!  But if rumors of my shameful imprisonment reach my ears, I will know who to hunt down for vengeance.~
@4865 = ~ <CHARNAME> -- what were you thinking? You were really going to leave her?  HERE?!~
@4866 = ~I know how you feel about these things, Fade.  I knew it would do your heart good to know that *you* freed her, not me. (Smile)  Does it feel good to be somebody's hero?~
@4867 = ~This is no time for foolish sentiment.  I don't trust anyone or any *thing* in this place, Fade.  How could you even know she'd tell us the truth?  Or not turn on us, for that matter?~
@4868 = ~I'm sorry, Fade.~
@4869 = ~(You've never seen Fade smile so brightly before -- ever.) It...feels great.  Better than great! (She bumps your hip with hers, still grinning.) Come on. Let's get going before I do something stupid like blush or something.~
@4870 = ~Whether she's telling the truth or not, nobody -- NOBODY -- deserves to die like that.  (Fade looks at you pointedly and shakes her head with obvious annoyance.)  You can be a real ass sometimes, <CHARNAME>, you know that? Bah, I don't want to talk about it anymore, let's get going.~
@4871 = ~Yeah, you *should be*. I figured you -- of all people -- would know better.  Let's go, you can make it up to me later.~
@4872 = ~That's right, you bastard, you bleed just like everybody else! And this one's for Ehlastra!~
@4873 = ~What--? That traitorous wench! I'll make sure she suffers for this!~
@4874 = ~No you won't. Ehlastra is gone and you'll never hurt her again.  But <CHARNAME> and I can hurt *you* just fine!~
@4875 = ~Why am I not surprised? Melissan seems to have a gift for *not* being there when she's needed.~
@4876 = ~Is it *that* obvious?~
@4877 = ~I'm not sure I like where this is going, <CHARNAME>...~
@4878 = ~<CHARNAME>, *please* let's not deal with that scumbag again! There has *got* to be a better way!~
@4879 = ~Why you double-crossing, slimy, dog-faced--!~
@4880 = ~And *I* smell the taint of half-digested...*something*...on you. Ugh!~
@4881 = ~Oh, gods-- What did they *do* to this guy?~
@4882 = ~No matter where we go, we see crazy people.  They're everywhere!  They don't even know they're crazy.~
@4883 = ~Well, then, it's a good thing your opinion doesn't count, eh?~
@4884 = ~You seem to have *really* rotten luck when it comes to drow masters.~
@4885 = ~Tell me about it!~
@4886 = ~Let me guess... You want *us* to go in there deal with this *great evil* while the rest of you just...watch.  I guess they don't call it "Watcher's Keep" for nothing.~
@4887 = ~Maybe so, but that doesn't mean we trust you or anything you have to say.~
@4888 = ~Ahh, I see you travel with one of my own kin!  Perhaps we may yet come to some kind of agreement, godling, hmmm?~
@4889 = ~Yep.  There is *definitely* something wrong with this one.~
@4890 = ~Watch yourself, <CHARNAME>.  You know very well that succubi are not to be trusted.~
@4891 = ~Oh, *do* be silent dearest sister. Such unmerited slander is rather unbecoming of you.~
@4892 = ~(Quietly) What a sad and terrible way to die. (Shudder) <CHARNAME>, let's hurry up and get out of here, shall we?~
@4893 = ~Something doesn't feel right, <CHARNAME>. I...don't think we're...alone.~
@4894 = ~(Fade is crouching on the ground, her arms wrapped around herself, shivering.)~
@4895 = ~I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! It's this place... this situation. I can't help it! There's too much blood... too much carnage...~
@4896 = ~I know, Fade, I know. Just try to hold it together a little longer. We'll get through this together.~
@4897 = ~It's okay... this place is hard on both of us. Just at least try to think before you act, Fade. You could end up getting us into a lot of trouble if you're not careful.~
@4898 = ~What the hell were you thinking?! I know that you don't cope too well in these kinds of situations, but even so! You have to at least try!~
@4899 = ~(drop to the floor beside her and wrap an arm around her shoulders) It's okay, my love... I know these situations are hard on you. Just try to hold on, okay? It'll be over soon. It has to be.~
@4900 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I promise I'll try harder to sublimate these feelings to something more productive from now on. I truly am sorry.~
@4901 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. I tend to forget that you must have a hard time sublimating your own desires, given your heritage. I fear you are much better at it than I am!~
@4902 = ~I will try my hardest to control myself from now on, though. The last thing you need is to be worrying about me. I'm sorry.~
@4903 = ~I know! And I do try! But sometimes it's just so hard... I can't seem to help myself. The tension builds and I feel as if I'm going to explode...~
@4904 = ~(sigh) I promise I'll try harder to control these urges from now on. I truly am sorry.~
@4905 = ~(Fade gratefully returns your embrace.) I feel dreadful, <CHARNAME>. I feel that I have really let you, and everyone else, down. I hate it when this happens... if there was a way to expunge these urges, I would do it!~
@4906 = ~I promise I'll try harder to control my temper in the future. I truly am sorry.~
@4907 = ~I suppose we should get used to hostility such as that. Bhaalspawn are going to be blamed for any disturbance of the peace now... and you, as one of the better known ones, are going to bear the brunt of that.~
@4908 = ~I know. To be honest, I'm surprised it hasn't happened before.~
@4909 = ~Yes, and it pains me that I had to fight. The soldiers of that army were only doing their job. I am sure they were all good men and women, people I would under normal circumstances have sided with. These are indeed evil times that are upon us, Fade.~
@4910 = ~Bring them on. If they are stupid enough to go up against me, then they deserve to die.~
@4911 = ~I wish they'd just all go and leave me alone. I have been made a scapegoat for Saradush and nothing more. Will no one listen to reason?~
@4912 = ~Are you all right? There were so many of them... I couldn't keep you in my sights. (sigh) It's times like this when I realise just how vulnerable we both are.~
@4913 = ~Well... before, most of your fights and grudges were personal, and although other people were affected, it definitely wasn't on such a large scale. Things are only going to get harder and more hostile, aren't they, <CHARNAME>?~
@4914 = ~Yes, they are. I don't know how this is going to end, but at the moment, I can't see a very good conclusion to it all.~
@4915 = ~Yes... and every time I have to fight innocent people, it pains me. The soldiers of that army were only doing their job; I am sure they were all good men and women, people I would under normal circumstances have sided with. These are indeed evil times that are upon us, Fade.~
@4916 = ~Yes, I fear they are. And that makes me doubly glad to have you by my side through all of this. If it wasn't for you...~
@4917 = ~I just wish they'd just all go and leave me alone. I have been made a scapegoat for Saradush and nothing more. Will no one listen to reason?~
@4918 = ~If they're stupid enough to confront and challenge me, then they deserve everything they get. They simply deserve to die... I have no sympathy for them.~
@4919 = ~Heh, they didn't have to fight you, <CHARNAME>... they could say no. Just blindly following orders is not an excuse. Considering your reputation as the near-saviour of the Sword Coast, I would have thought they may have paused to think for a moment before they attacked you.~
@4920 = ~How likely is it that one person who averted one war would start another one for no reason at all! They knew Yaga Shura was attacking Saradush before you did. They just want a scapegoat, that's all.~
@4921 = ~How can you say that? I realise that the people orchestrating such an attack on me are simply seeking an easy solution, but the poor people working for them... they have to do their duty. They've been told it's the right thing to do, and that I am the evil foe.~
@4922 = ~Imagine if you had lost loved ones in the destruction of Saradush and had been told that the Bhaalspawn called <CHARNAME> was responsible for their deaths. You'd want to fight too, and I hardly call that blindly following orders. There are people here who don't have our "insider knowledge". Fade.~
@4923 = ~Of course they just want a scapegoat, but it doesn't make me feel any better about killing them. If only I could reason with them...~
@4924 = ~That's a bit of a harsh sentiment, <CHARNAME>, but I can see where you're coming from. It's easier to blame a scapegoat for such things, and as the survivor and apparent victor, you are the simplest choice.~
@4925 = ~Simplest choice, maybe, but that does not equate to the easiest defeat. Hopefully this will make those orchestrating these attacks to think twice. I have defeated one army, as I shall defeat any other that crosses my path!~
@4926 = ~The charges were levelled at me, but they attacked you too. I am not about the stand there and let them do that. Anyone who threatens you and what we have will be dealt with. I don't care if they are the most evil of Necromancers or the most righteous of Paladins--they will be slain.~
@4927 = ~I'm glad you see my point. I was worried that you would try to give me some little sanctimonious talk about how such sentiments are wrong. I'm only being honest.~
@4928 = ~Well, we agree, and that is a good thing. Let's just carry on.~
@4929 = ~People only listen to reason when they want to, <CHARNAME>, and I get the feeling reason is the last thing these people want. They want to blame someone and make them pay. I have a feeling things are going to get worse before they get any better.~
@4930 = ~If things ever do get any better...~
@4931 = ~I do kind of feel sorry for them. Imagine if you had lost loved ones in the destruction of Saradush and had been told that the Bhaalspawn called <CHARNAME> was responsible for their deaths. You'd want to fight too. I can't blame the common soldiery for what is going on.~
@4932 = ~Come on--chin up, Fade! Things will get better, just you see. In a couple of months from now, we'll look back at this and wonder why we were ever so despondent.~
@4933 = ~I am capable of looking after myself, <CHARNAME>. I'm not made of spun glass, you know!~
@4934 = ~I know. You are a fearsome fighter, but you are also carrying our child and that gives me every right in the world to worry about whether you're okay! I lost sight of you so many times, I think I spent more time worrying about you than I did fending off enemies! If anything happened to you... I simply have no idea what I'd do.~
@4935 = ~(grin) And don't I know it! Please forgive this poor, concerned male... he knows deep down you are more than capable of looking after yourself, but his terribly manly ego means he wants to be the one who keeps you safe from harm.~
@4936 = ~Fade, I'm being serious! That last battle... I was really scared. If you had gotten into trouble, there would have been no way of me knowing. I swear to every God I can think of that *anyone* who threatens you and what we have will be dealt with. I don't care if they are the most evil of Necromancers or the most righteous of Paladins--they will be slain.~
@4937 = ~Well... we've got each other, and that's a lot more than many people can say. I know it's hard, but we should try to concentrate on that rather than all the bad stuff. No matter what happens, I'll always be there for you, <CHARNAME>.~
@4938 = ~And I'll always be there for you too. Together we can conquer anything that opposes us!~
@4939 = ~That is true. Without you, I have no idea how I would be able to deal with all of this.~
@4940 = ~It does my heart good to hear you say such things to me, Fade. Sometimes I worry that I will indeed lose myself to all of this--but with you, I know I can remain true to myself. You are my rock, my love and my life.~
@4941 = ~(grin) You'd get a lot more sleep and have a lot less to worry about!~
@4942 = ~Seriously, though... I'm just happy to be here with you, and no matter what happens, I'll always be there for you, <CHARNAME>. Nothing will ever change that. I know it's hard, but we should try to concentrate on each other rather than all the bad stuff that is going on.~
@4943 = ~(grin) I like the sound of that "concentrating on each other" bit! Got anything specific in mind?~
@4944 = ~Sod duty, <CHARNAME>! If these people scratched the surface of the lies they have been told, they would see that you are not the scourge they have been led to believe you are.~
@4945 = ~They've taken the easy route, and if there's one thing I've learnt from you, it's that just because it's easy doesn't make it right.~
@4946 = ~Heh... if there's one thing I love about you, it's your ability to think things through reasonably. Half the sodding Tethyrian army comes baying for your blood and you resolutely manage to see their side of the argument! Sometimes I really wonder how do you do it.~
@4947 = ~Well, I have you by my side and that helps a hell of a lot. I don't know what I'd do without you, you know.~
@4948 = ~You just have to try to stay positive, Fade. I know it is hard, but in a couple of months from now, we'll look back at this and wonder why we were ever so despondent, just you wait and see!~
@4949 = ~Heh... if there's one thing I envy about you, it's your ability to think things through reasonably. Half the sodding Tethyrian army comes baying for your blood and you resolutely manage to see their side of the argument! Sometimes I really wonder how do you do it. (grin)~
@4950 = ~Hopefully it will. Someone will certainly hear about just how powerful you have become recently.~
@4951 = ~It's at times like this I could almost believe that Alaundo's Prophecy does indeed apply to you and you only. I have no doubt your power will become the stuff of legend... if it hasn't already.~
@4952 = ~(Fade gives you a long, scrutinising look before she answers you.) It is... nice to know that you hold our relationship in such high regard, <CHARNAME>. But be careful with such sentiments... I would hate to see them destroy you.~
@4953 = ~You are growing so powerful. Sometimes... well, sometimes you can be a little bit frightening.~
@4954 = ~Frightening? What do you mean?~
@4955 = ~Of course I'm frightening... but only to those who I want to frighten. I don't want to frighten you. Do I frighten you?~
@4956 = ~How could such sentiments destroy me? I just want to safeguard what we have, that is all.~
@4957 = ~And as they say, honesty is often the best policy.~
@4958 = ~(She pauses for a moment and looks away from you, chewing her bottom lip.)~
@4959 = ~And...?~
@4960 = ~(sigh) Come on, Fade--I know that look. What do you want to tell me? I promise I won't be angry.~
@4961 = ~Well, I'm glad we agree. Let's just carry on.~
@4962 = ~Yes, let's do just that. Only... <CHARNAME>... if you do ever want to discuss any of this in the future, you know you can always talk to me, don't you? I... I just don't like to think of you shouldering this on your own, okay?~
@4963 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, of course things will get better! Look at all the things we have to look forward to! One day all of this will be over--it can't go on forever.~
@4964 = ~And when it is over, just think of all the things we can do, and all the places we can go. This time will be nothing but a distance memory by then. That is the thought I hold on to... I hope you can hold on to it too.~
@4965 = ~I will try, Fade, I really will--I promise you.~
@4966 = ~Indeed--we have much to look forward to. Such stories we will have to tell our little one! I wonder if it will even believe half of what we tell it.~
@4967 = ~Of course things will get better, <CHARNAME>! One day all of this will be over--it can't go on forever. There will be a time when you'll have time to do things for yourself ... this period of your life will be nothing but a distance memory by then.~
@4968 = ~You never know, maybe one day in the future, we'll be in a tavern somewhere and we'll be able to have a good laugh about it all!~
@4969 = ~I hope you're right, <CHARNAME>, I really do. We have much to look forward to, I suppose... and one day all of this will be over--it can't go on forever.~
@4970 = ~I hope you're right, <CHARNAME>, I really do. You never know, maybe one day in the future, we'll be in a tavern somewhere and we'll be able to have a good laugh about it all of this!~
@4971 = ~So you'd rather I fainted each time a battle came along and simpered behind you whilst you defended me dramatically from our foes, huh? Well, sorry darlin'--it isn't *ever* going to be like that!~
@4972 = ~But I do appreciate your concern, for... both of us, even though it is inevitable that things are only going to get harder and more hostile from now on. It's sometimes hard to stay optimistic, isn't it?~
@4973 = ~Yes, it is. I don't know how this is going to end, but at the moment, I can't see a very good conclusion to it all.~
@4974 = ~(grin) You'd deal fine with it. I'd be the one who would fall to pieces if anything happened to you!~
@4975 = ~As you are mine. I truly was lost before I met you... I do not know what I would do without you. We have been through so much together already... we will get through this as well. Of that I am certain.~
@4976 = ~(Fade grins and leans towards you. What she whispers to you is certainly inventive and graphic enough to leave you blushing.)~
@4977 = ~Well, that would certainly be... quite instructive. Can two people even *do* that?~
@4978 = ~I've said it before and I'll say it again... filthy, wicked minx! Now, uh, let me just sit down for a while...~
@4979 = ~Well... that's certainly something to look forward to, isn't it? (wink)~
@4980 = ~I don't mean anything by it, just that, whether you like it or not, you *are* changing. You certainly aren't the same young man that came to see Aran. We've all changed with you--that I don't deny--but you're truly on the verge of becoming something quite... different.~
@4981 = ~I can almost taste the power emanating from you... but such things inevitably come with a price. I just hope it isn't too high, that's all.~
@4982 = ~Sometimes. And even then, it's not you that frightens me as such... it's more what you *could* become. Even if you don't see it, you're changing. You're truly on the verge of becoming something quite... different.~
@4983 = ~I know you do, and that is very sweet of you! But where you are capable of feeling and expressing great love for me, you are also capable of feeling and expressing great hatred too, and I know first hand that hate only has the power to destroy.~
@4984 = ~I have seen too many people consumed by hatred--including myself--not to know what can happen. It is a very self-destructive thing, and that is what I fear. And for one so powerful, you'll bring down entire nations with you. I just want you to be careful, that is all. Because I do not know what I would do if I lost you.~
@4985 = ~And... whilst it is nice to know that you hold our relationship in such high regard,  please be careful with such sentiments. I would hate to see them destroy you.~
@4986 = ~Ahhh, I knew it was too good to be true! Here's the sanctimony. How could such sentiments destroy me? I just want to safeguard what we have, that is all.~
@4987 = ~Won't you? Sometimes I don't know. I know you are capable of feeling and expressing great love for me... but you are also capable of feeling and expressing great hatred too, and I know first hand that hate only has the power to destroy.~
@4988 = ~hat is all I would ever ask... for you to try. Know that whatever happens, I will be here, right by your side. If it is within my power,  I will not let you face anything alone.~
@4989 = ~I wonder that too. "Mummy is a part demon and Daddy is a Bhaalspawn, and together we fought many enemies including powerful Vampires, mad Mages, an invincible Fire Giant and a whole platoon of Tethyrian Soldiers..."~
@4990 = ~Hell, I've been through it all with you and even *I* think it sounds pretty far-fetched! Still, I suppose it isn't as far-fetched as us becoming parents... as me becoming a mother. Come on, let's get on.~
@4991 = ~Answering that would take all the fun out of trying to find out for ourselves, <CHARNAME>...~
@4992 = ~(grin) What's wrong, <CHARNAME>? Finding it a little... "hard" to walk?~
@4993 = ~(She sniggers and flicks her tail at you.) Just wait until later...~
@4994 = ~Oh yes... I believe it is! (wink) It most certainly is...~
@4995 = ~Oh, I am tired... it seems I've had all the strength sapped out of me today. (yawn) Sorry to be a pain, but can we rest?~
@4996 = ~Yes, of course we can stop. I still need to talk to everyone about your condition anyway.~
@4997 = ~I wasn't planning to stop for the night yet, but we can stop for a short while. It gives me a good opportunity to tell everyone my plan too.~
@4998 = ~Can't you hold out just a little bit longer, Fade? This really isn't the best place to stop right now. I know you must be tired, considering the baby and all, but we have to find somewhere safe first.~
@4999 = ~No, I'm not sick. I'm just... tired.~
@5000 = ~(groan) Oh, <CHARNAME>... can't this wait? Please?~
@5001 = ~No, it can't wait. I think everyone has the right to know.~
@5002 = ~There is an old saying, my dear... "Honesty is the best policy". The longer we leave this, the harder it will get. I think it is better for everyone to be told now than to find out the hard way later!~
@5003 = ~This is for your own benefit, Fade. I just want to keep you and the baby safe, that's all.~
@5004 = ~(groan) Oh, <CHARNAME>, we need to discuss this further. Can't it wait? Please?~
@5005 = ~(mumble) Kind of... <CHARNAME>, can't this wait? Please?~
@5006 = ~Heh, if only you knew the truth... <CHARNAME>, can't this wait? Please?~
@5007 = ~<CHARNAME>, I know you find little things like tact hard, but can't this wait? *Please*?~
@5008 = ~(sigh) Okay--tell them. I suppose it is better they find out this way than the hard way...~
@5009 = ~Ummm, everyone... please, I need you to listen to me. This may come as a bit of a shock to you all, but I have an announcement to make, and a rather pleasant one at that. You all know that Fade and I are very much in love, and I just want you all to know that she is carrying my child. She is not far along, but it still makes her a little vulnerable in battle. I have asked her to take up a ranged weapon in combat, but I would also like to ask all of you to help keep her, and therefore our baby, safe from harm. Err... thank you!~
@5010 = ~Well, as I said, I think you all have the right to know--Fade's pregnant. We're not exactly sure when the baby is due--heh, I suppose we'd better go and see someone about that--but it does mean that she's not going to be charging into battle anymore. So... well... that's it, really.~
@5011 = ~Yes, it is much better this way than halfway though a battle! I think you should all know that Fade is... well, she's pregnant. That means if she gets injured, I want her healed as soon as it is possible. I... I am counting on you all, as friends, to understand that one major injury could grievously harm the baby, and so I want to minimise this risk as much as I possibly can.~
@5012 = ~Fair enough. Honesty is the best policy, but don't go ordering people around, okay? Just...tell them the truth and let them make their own minds up as to what they want to do about it! I have a feeling not everyone is going to be as ecstatic about this as you are...~
@5013 = ~Stop being so negative! How could they not be happy about something so joyous? Ummm, everyone... please, I need you to listen to me. This may come as a bit of a shock to you all, but I have an announcement to make, and a rather pleasant one at that. You all know that Fade and I are very much in love, and I just want you all to know that she is carrying my child. She is not far along, but it still makes her a little vulnerable in battle. I have asked her to take up a ranged weapon in combat, but I would also like to ask all of you to help keep her, and therefore our baby, safe from harm. Err... thank you!~
@5014 = ~Well, I'll just tell them the truth and then let them make their own minds up. It's our baby, not theirs. I just think they have the right to know. Well, as I said, I think you all have the right to know--Fade's pregnant. We're not exactly sure when the baby is due--heh, I suppose we'd better go and see someone about that--but it does mean that she's not going to be charging into battle anymore. So... well... that's it, really.~
@5015 = ~That may be the case, but they're going to be a lot more pissed off if I don't say anything and then you get injured. At least this way we are all prepared! I think you should all know that Fade is... well, she's pregnant. That means if she gets injured, I want her healed as soon as it is possible. I... I am counting on you all, as friends, to understand that one major injury could grievously harm the baby, and so I want to minimise this risk as much as I possibly can.~
@5016 = ~(sigh) You seem to have a bee in his bonnet about all of this, <CHARNAME>...~
@5017 = ~Oh, stop being so negative, Fade. Ummm, everyone... please, I need you to listen to me. This may come as a bit of a shock to you all, but I have an announcement to make, and a rather pleasant one at that. You all know that Fade and I are very much in love, and I just want you all to know that she is carrying my child. She is not far along, but it still makes her a little vulnerable in battle. I have asked her to take up a ranged weapon in combat, but I would also like to ask all of you to help keep her, and therefore our baby, safe from harm. Err... thank you!~
@5018 = ~Well, just in case you haven't realised, I think it's only fair that you all know--Fade is indeed pregnant. We're not exactly sure when the baby is due--heh, I suppose we'd better go and see someone about that--but it does mean that she's not going to be charging into battle anymore. So... well... that's it, really.~
@5019 = ~Of course I have a "bee in my bonnet", as you so eloquently put it. I just want to keep you safe! I think you should all know that Fade is... well, she's pregnant. That means if she gets injured, I want her healed as soon as it is possible. I... I am counting on you all, as friends, to understand that one major injury could grievously harm the baby, and so I want to minimise this risk as much as I possibly can.~
@5020 = ~Fade looks up at your approach, one crimson eyebrow quirked inquiringly.) Yes, <CHARNAME>?~
@5021 = ~Fade, I need to talk to you about our baby.~
@5022 = ~Fade... can I speak with you, alone? I have something to ask you.~
@5023 = ~Fair enough. What is it?~
@5024 = ~You're not going to like me for saying this, because I know you pride yourself in your fighting skills... but when I see you in battle, I do fear for you, and for the baby. I... could not stand to see either of you hurt.~
@5025 = ~I don't think you should be getting involved in melee combat anymore, Fade. Every time I see you engage with an enemy, my heart is in my mouth. I don't want to lose you or our baby.~
@5026 = ~Considering your condition, do you still feel up to all the fighting we get in to?~
@5027 = ~(grin) I have no intention of getting hurt, <CHARNAME>!~
@5028 = ~(Her grin falters, though, when she sees your worried look.) What are you implying?~
@5029 = ~I'm not implying anything. I just want to ask you something. Please, don't get involved in melee combat. If not for yourself, then for the sake of the child. One blow to the gut and that could be it.~
@5030 = ~I'm implying that I would rather see you fighting from the back line, possibly using a ranged weapon. Or... or not getting involved in the battle at all.~
@5031 = ~Please... I know you're finding it hard to come to terms with your pregnancy, but you have to start looking after yourself! If... if you get injured, even a tiny bit, please... just run away. Don't be a hero, just stay safe.~
@5032 = ~(Fade's tail begins to flick from side to side.) So you think I can't handle myself in battle anymore, is that what you're saying?~
@5033 = ~(sigh) No, of course not. What I am saying is that I couldn't stand to see either you or the baby getting hurt. You... you have to face up to the fact that you're going to be a mother, Fade, and take care!~
@5034 = ~(grin) I would never say that--you've protected my back to often! However... I do think that a front line position is not for you. What happens if you get hit? One blow to the gut and that could be it.~
@5035 = ~No, I'm saying I would feel a lot happier if you fought from the back line... possibly using a ranged weapon. Or... or not getting involved in the battle at all.~
@5036 = ~Of course I feel up to it! I'm pregnant, <CHARNAME>, not sick. What's bothering you?~
@5037 = ~I know you're not sick, but between you and the baby, I cannot help but feel that one sword-stroke is all it would take to shatter my world. I... I find it very hard to see you getting involved in battle, Fade.~
@5038 = ~I... I just don't think you should be getting involved in melee combat anymore, Fade. Every time I see you engage with an enemy, my heart is in my mouth. I don't want to lose you or our baby.~
@5039 = ~Nothing is bothering me, per se. I'd just rather you fought from the back line... if at all. Maybe you could use ranged weapons from now on.~
@5040 = ~(She unconsciously places a hand over her belly and nods slowly.) To be honest, I have thought of this myself. I... I want to be able to carry on as usual, to prove that my pregnancy will be of no hindrance to our quest, but I suppose it is time to be realistic now.~
@5041 = ~As much as I hate to admit it, I am going to become less and less useful to you as a front line fighter as this babe grows.~
@5042 = ~You're a pretty good shot... you are going to be just as invaluable to me in battle using a ranged weapon as you are with a sword. I know asking you not to fight is futile, but please consider this instead.~
@5043 = ~I'm not saying you're going to be useless in battle, but please consider yourself when we fight. If you get injured--even if it is only a minor wound--get yourself out of the situation. Run away and seek healing immediately. I will tell everybody you have priority for any healing that is done. I will not lose you or our child.~
@5044 = ~I know I cannot tell you what to do in battle, but... just take care and don't take any unnecessary risks. I... I don't know what would happen to the baby if we had to resurrect you... and I don't want to find out, to be quite honest.~
@5045 = ~I... I have to get involved in battle, <CHARNAME>. I couldn't leave it up to the rest of you to fight alone. Unless you don't want me to travel with you anymore...~
@5046 = ~I'd be lying if I hadn't considered secreting you away somewhere safe until the baby is born, but I also know I'd catch hell from you for suggesting it! Just... try to stay out of trouble, okay? Don't charge headlong into battle; if you're not needed, don't get involved at all if possible. Please.~
@5047 = ~Of course I want you to travel with me! I'm not suggesting that you go for one moment! I'm just saying that you're a pretty good shot... you are going to be just as invaluable to me in battle using a ranged weapon as you are with a sword. I know asking you not to fight is futile, but please consider this instead.~
@5048 = ~I'm not going to send you off, Fade--that wouldn't be fair on either of us. However, please, consider yourself when we fight. If you get injured--even if it is only a minor wound--get yourself out of the situation. Run away and seek healing immediately. I will tell everybody you have priority for any healing that is done. I will not lose you or our child.~
@5049 = ~I can't just run away, <CHARNAME>. What happens if you get injured? What happens if you need me to watch your back? There's no point in me saving myself for the sake of the baby if you then get killed!~
@5050 = ~Fade, I'm not going to get killed! Seeing you get injured in the past was enough of a trial for me, but now I know what you carry... all I am saying is just... try to stay out of trouble, okay? Don't charge headlong into battle; if you're not needed, don't get involved at all if possible. Please.~
@5051 = ~I know we all take risks every day of our lives, but you aren't just responsible for one person now--you are in effect two! Please consider yourself first when we fight. If you get injured--even if it is only a minor wound--get yourself out of the situation. Run away and seek healing immediately. I will tell everybody you have priority for any healing that is done. I will not lose you or our child.~
@5052 = ~I know you're finding it hard to come to terms with everything right now, but you have to take care of yourself and don't take any unnecessary risks. I... I don't know what would happen to the baby if we had to resurrect you... and I don't want to find out, to be quite honest.~
@5053 = ~You can still watch my back for me--just do it from a distance. You're a pretty good shot... you are going to be just as invaluable to me in battle using a ranged weapon as you are with a sword. I know asking you not to fight is futile, but please consider this instead.~
@5054 = ~(Unconsciously, she places a hand over her belly and looks a little defensive.) I know--you don't have to rub it in! I... I just don't want to become a burden on the party, I want to be able to be useful! I couldn't just stand there in a fight, not getting involved and watching you risk your neck.~
@5055 = ~What happens if you get killed? There's no point in me saving myself for the baby's sake if you get killed because I stood there and did nothing!~
@5056 = ~I have always found it very hard to see you fight, no matter how good you are at it. I... I realise that I am going to become less and less useful to you as a fighter--the least you can do is allow me to prove my worth to you now! I don't want to stand on the sidelines, watching you risk your neck...~
@5057 = ~But you have nothing to prove to me! I know of your usefulness in battle-- you've proven that to me time and time again. Now I want you to use the passion and fire that you fight with and utilise it to keep our baby safe... please...~
@5058 = ~Fade... please! This is not about you proving yourself to anyone--you have to take care of yourself and not take any unnecessary risks. I... I don't know what would happen to the baby if we had to resurrect you... and I don't want to find out, to be quite honest.~
@5059 = ~I'm not saying that I won't need your help anymore--far from it! Just... help me from a distance. You're a pretty good shot... you are going to be just as invaluable to me in battle using a ranged weapon as you are with a sword. I know asking you not to fight is futile, but please consider this instead.~
@5060 = ~Fade, please... do not feel you have anything to prove to me. By carrying this child, you are worth more to me than you ever was as a fighter! All I am asking is that you consider yourself first when we fight. If you get injured--even if it is only a minor wound--get yourself out of the situation. Run away and seek healing immediately. I will tell everybody you have priority for any healing that is done. I will not lose you or our child.~
@5061 = ~I... I will consider it, <CHARNAME>. It does make sense. I can use a bow quite effectively... maybe I should practise a little? Then I could be even more useful... I can pick them off from a distance. All right. I will do this for you.~
@5062 = ~There is one more thing. Please, promise me: if you get injured--even if it is only a minor wound--get yourself out of the situation. Run away and seek healing immediately. I will tell everybody you have priority for any healing that is done. I will not lose you or our child.~
@5063 = ~That is all I ask. Just... stay safe, and don't take any unnecessary risks. I... I don't know what would happen to the baby if we had to resurrect you... and I don't want to find out, to be quite honest.~
@5064 = ~Thank you for agreeing to do this. Not just for me, or for yourself, but for the sake of our child. See, little one? See how lucky you are? What a fantastic mother you have.~
@5065 = ~(She sighs with relief, obviously happy that you are not about to send her away.) Thank you for squashing one of my deepest fears, <CHARNAME>. One... one of the reasons I kept quiet about the baby is because I was worried you would send me away.~
@5066 = ~I... I do not want to leave your side through any of this. And to that end, I will agree to stay out of trouble as much as I can. What would you suggest that I do?~
@5067 = ~My suggestion is quite simple: if you get injured--even if it is only a minor wound--get yourself out of the situation. Run away and seek healing immediately. I will tell everybody you have priority for any healing that is done. I will not lose you or our child.~
@5068 = ~Well, you're a pretty good shot. You are going to be just as invaluable to me in battle using a ranged weapon as you are with a sword. Since I know asking you not to fight is futile, you can at least do it from a distance. That way you have plenty of time to get away if the battle turns sour.~
@5069 = ~I know well your fears. I have not slept properly since you told me of this child, wondering and worrying about how we can keep you safe. Just... don't play the hero. No one will blame you if you have to fall back--in fact, I will be angry if you don't! Use a bow if necessary, just stay out of the thick of things!~
@5070 = ~What? You expect me to run away?! But... but I have never run from a battle! And as for priority healing... what if someone else is more grievously injured? What if someone risks losing their life?!~
@5071 = ~<CHARNAME>... I will try to stay safe for you, and for the child I carry, but you cannot expect everyone else to drop everything in my defence!~
@5072 = ~I can, and I will! I am going to call a... a meeting. It is about time everyone knew. I am proud to become a father, and I intend to make sure everyone knows that I will not allow you or our baby to come to any harm whatsoever! I mean it, Fade. The slightest scratch, and you will be administered to.~
@5073 = ~Well, that's the way it's going to be. While I am in no doubt that you are strong and can shake of damage, we do not know what the shock of an injury will do to our baby. Everyone will understand, of that I am sure.~
@5074 = ~I only want to do what is best for you and the child, my love. I cannot pretend that we do not tread a dangerous path right now, and we need to make sure you are safeguarded from all unnecessary harm. If you are to get involved in battles, then I am going to make sure you are safe from harm. That is all.~
@5075 = ~That is something I had not considered... I have no idea what would happen to the babe either if I were to be raised.~
@5076 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... I knew this was going to be hard, but not this hard! Life was dangerous before, but now... so many responsibilities... I don't know how I am going to cope! How can I prevent something as awful as that from happening?~
@5077 = ~We will cope, my love. You're a pretty good shot--you are going to be just as invaluable to me in battle using a ranged weapon as you are with a sword. Since I know asking you not to fight is futile, you can at least do it from a distance. That way you have plenty of time to get away if the battle turns sour.~
@5078 = ~You say you're not going to get killed... but I will not stand there and watch you put yourself in unnecessary danger either! But... as a compromise, I will agree to stay out of trouble as much as I can. What would you suggest that I do?~
@5079 = ~You want me to stay? Oh, <CHARNAME>... I really feared you would want me to leave! Thank you for squashing one of my deepest fears. One... one of the reasons I kept quiet about the baby is because I was worried you would send me away.~ ~I... I do not want to leave your side through any of this. And to that end, I will agree to stay out of trouble as much as I can. What would you suggest that I do?~
@5080 = ~I could never send you away! You're a pretty good shot--you are going to be just as invaluable to me in battle using a ranged weapon as you are with a sword. Since I know asking you not to fight is futile, you can at least do it from a distance. That way you have plenty of time to get away if the battle turns sour.~
@5081 = ~Sending you away never even crossed my mind, Fade. This child is ours, and so I bear as much responsibility for it as you do. Just... don't play the hero. No one will blame you if you have to fall back--in fact, I will be angry if you don't! Use a bow if necessary, just stay out of the thick of things!~
@5082 = ~If that is your wish... then I will do it. I will keep our baby safe. I can use a ranged weapon--I can use a bow quite effectively. Maybe I should practise a little? Then I could be even more useful... I can pick them off from a distance. All right. I will do this for you.~
@5083 = ~I... I think there was a compliment tied up in there somewhere. And I think I know what you're trying to say. But any fool can get themselves pregnant... being able to wield a sword is much more of a talent!~
@5084 = ~I have never, ever run from a battle in my life, and I do not mean to start now! And as for priority healing... what if someone else is more grievously injured? What if someone risks losing their life?!~
@5085 = ~Hardly. More like a fantastic, caring father. I would never have thought twice about getting involved in a battle if you hadn't said anything to me... now I will definitely think twice.~
@5086 = ~(She looks down at her belly.) Come on, little one. We have some training to do!~
@5087 = ~That is true, and if that is your wish... then I will do it. I will keep our baby safe. I will use a ranged weapon--I can use a bow quite effectively. aybe I should practise a little? Then I could be even more useful... I can pick them off from a distance. All right. I will do this for you.~
@5088 = ~All I ask is that you don't play the hero. No one will blame you if you have to fall back--in fact, I will be angry if you don't! Using a bow is a good idea... just stay out of the thick of things!~
@5089 = ~<CHARNAME>! You are overreacting to all this! I know you are concerned, but directing everyone's healing efforts to me and me alone is totally unrealistic. Of course, tell the others about my pregnancy--that only makes sense--but do not try to make them all responsible for something we have done.~
@5090 = ~I will endeavour to improve my ranged weapon skills--that way I will be mostly out of the thick of battle. But unless you force me to leave this party, there is always going to be a risk of injury. It needn't even be a battle; a sprung trap or a falling rock could do just as much damage!~
@5091 = ~I appreciate your concern, I really do, but you cannot treat me with kid gloves. I know this is not going to be easy... but I will do everything I can to keep myself and the baby safe, for your sake as much as my own.~
@5092 = ~Please... trust me in this. I will not let you down.~
@5093 = ~I am sure they will, but at the same time, if another is holding on to life with a single thread, then surely they take priority?~
@5094 = ~<CHARNAME>... I appreciate your concern over this, I really do, but we cannot make others take responsibility for something we have done. Of course, tell the others of this babe--at some point they are going to realise anyway, and it is only common courtesy to let them know--but let me... let us... make sure it is safe and well.~
@5095 = ~If this child is anything like its father, it will be a fighter anyway; I doubt anything will faze it at all, and it will be born strong and fit, just you see!~
@5096 = ~In the meantime, I will practice my bow skills and make sure I am as effective in a fight from the back row as I am by your side. Please... trust me in this. I will not let you down.~
@5097 = ~I understand that, <CHARNAME>. Just do not try to make others responsible for this child. We are its parents, and so the responsibility for its welfare lies squarely with us.~
@5098 = ~If it concerns you that much, I can use a ranged weapon, maybe... something that keeps me out of the thick of a fight, anyway. That way I can still be of use to you.~
@5099 = ~Then it is settled... I shall use a ranged weapon. That way I can still be effective in battle, but I have more of a chance of keeping safe.~
@5100 = ~(She smiles and looks at her belly.) See, little one? Isn't it good that you have such a thoughtful and loving father? See how he cares for us.~
@5101 = ~(grin) And now we have some training to do--we need to make sure we can cover your father's back effectively when he gets himself into trouble!~
@5102 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. What is it you wish?~
@5103 = ~I, err... know in the grand scheme of things we haven't known each other that long, but we've been through a hell of a lot together... not just through battles and strife, but through love and understanding too. I've never felt this way about anyone before, and I know I never will again. You're the one for me, Fade... the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. Will you marry me?~
@5104 = ~I've been thinking... all this could end at any moment, so there isn't a better time than this. Fade, I love you. you've been my constant companion for a while now, fighting by my side. Will you marry me?~
@5105 = ~I've been thinking... all this could end at any moment, so there isn't a better time than this. Fade, I love you. you've been my constant companion for a while now, fighting by my side. You're also the mother of my child. Will you marry me?~
@5106 = ~I've been thinking... all this could end at any moment, so there isn't a better time than this. Fade, I love you. you've been my constant companion for a while now, fighting by my side. You're also the mother of my children. Will you marry me?~
@5107 = ~I got this for you. I wanted to give you a gift as poignant as the one you've given me, but I simply couldn't. I know a bauble cannot compare to the love you've shown me... the love we have, but I... I want you to have it.~
@5108 = ~How do you feel about marriage?~
@5109 = ~(You hold out the ring, and for what seems like an eternity, Fade stands there, saying nothing, her eyes wide.)~
@5110 = ~M-marry you? <CHARNAME>... why are you asking me this now? W-what is the purpose of it all?~
@5111 = ~The... purpose? My dear Fade, the purpose is to tell the entire world I love you! I want everyone to know how devoted I am to you, that we will never, ever be apart.~
@5112 = ~I'm asking you because I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I... I must admit, I had hoped your answer was going to be a little more positive.~
@5113 = ~(grin) Yes, marry me. I know it's a bit sudden, but you never know what's round the next bend, so to speak, and I want you to be in absolutely no doubt about my feelings towards you. I want you to be my wife; to be a part of my life forever.~
@5114 = ~(As you get down on one knee in front of her and offer her the ring, Fade stands open-mouthed, her eyes wide.)~
@5115 = ~Will I... marry you? W-what? You... you want me to be your wife?~
@5116 = ~Yes, I do want you to be my wife! I know it's a bit sudden, but you never know what's round the next bend, so to speak, and I want you to be in absolutely no doubt about my feelings towards you. I want you to be a part of my life forever.~
@5117 = ~Fade, I love you. It's simple as that. I don't want anyone else, I just want you. Now, I do believe I asked you a question...~
@5118 = ~Why must you always answer my questions with more questions? Yes, I want you to be my wife. I'm asking you to marry me because I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I... I must admit, I had hoped your answer was going to be a little more positive.~
@5119 = ~Is this simply because I'm pregnant? You don't have to do this to prove something, <CHARNAME>!~
@5120 = ~My sweet, I'm not asking you to do this simply because you're the mother of my child! This is not to prove anything--this is between you and I. I want to tell the entire world I love you! I want everyone to know how devoted I am to you, that we will never, ever be apart.~
@5121 = ~My sweet, I'm not asking you to do this simply because you're the mother of my children! This is not to prove anything--this is between you and I. I want to tell the entire world I love you! I want everyone to know how devoted I am to you, that we will never, ever be apart.~
@5122 = ~(Fade gasps as you show her the ring, and looks at you incredulously.) This... this is for me?~
@5123 = ~<CHARNAME>... you don't have to buy me trinkets to prove your love for me. You know that I love you more with every moment we share.~
@5124 = ~I know... and I want you to know I feel the same way. This is no mere gift, Fade. We've been through a hell of a lot together... not just through battles and strife, but through love and understanding too. I've never felt this way about anyone before, and I know I never will again. You're the one for me, Fade... the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. Will you marry me?~
@5125 = ~I didn't buy this "trinket", as you call it, for no reason at all. I've been considering this for a while now... all this could end at any moment, so there isn't a better time than this. Fade, I love you. you've been my constant companion for a while now, fighting by my side. Will you marry me?~
@5126 = ~I didn't buy this "trinket", as you call it, for no reason at all. I've been considering this for a while now... all this could end at any moment, so there isn't a better time than this. Fade, I love you. you've been my constant companion for a while now, fighting by my side. You're also the mother of my child. Will you marry me?~

Fade, I love you. you've been my constant companion for a while now, fighting by my side. You're also the mother of my children. Will you marry me?~
@5128 = ~I... I don't know. No one has ever asked me to consider it before. There certainly isn't any precedent or use for it amongst my people.~
@5129 = ~I think it's a beautiful thing if it is sincere... but I think it is rare that people are ever that sincere with each other. It should be the ultimate expression of two people's feelings for each other; the joining of their souls... but unfortunately it seems more often than not used as a convenient arrangement, or something foolish people feel they ought to do. Why do you ask?~
@5130 = ~I ask because it is something that has been playing on my mind recently. I know in the grand scheme of things we haven't known each other that long, but we've been through a hell of a lot together... not just through battles and strife, but through love and understanding too. I've never felt this way about anyone before, and I know I never will again. You're the one for me, Fade... the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. Will you marry me?~
@5131 = ~Simply because I've been thinking... all this could end at any moment, so there isn't a better time than this. Fade, I love you. you've been my constant companion for a while now, fighting by my side. Will you marry me?~
@5132 = ~Simply because I've been thinking... all this could end at any moment, so there isn't a better time than this. Fade, I love you. you've been my constant companion for a while now, fighting by my side. You're also the mother of my child. Will you marry me?~

@5134 = ~D-devoted? <CHARNAME>... this is all rather sudden! Marriage is something I have no experience of. I fear I will be a terrible wife! I can't cook, I loathe cleaning, I... I couldn't run a household to save my life! I...~
@5135 = ~Fade, I don't want to marry you so you can cook or clean for me, I want to marry you because I love you! I... I had hoped you would be happy with my proposal.~
@5136 = ~(sigh) Please, if you don't want to marry me, just say no. Please don't make up poor excuses.~
@5137 = ~(laugh) Do you honestly think that's why I would ask you to marry me? I fear you aren't listening to me. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I don't care if you can cook, or whether you hate cleaning... I love you the way you are. Will you marry me?~
@5138 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but your question has caught me by surprise! I... I was not expecting this. The Fey'ri have no use for marriage, and so that you might ask me to... marry you has never crossed my mind. I don't know what to say.~
@5139 = ~Well, you could always just say "yes".~
@5140 = ~Fade, if you want to say no, don't be afraid to. Yes, I will be disappointed, but I need the truth now.~
@5141 = ~Well, if you need time to make your decision, I can always give you that.~
@5142 = ~We would be together forever? You would never, ever leave me?~
@5143 = ~I feel I must warn you, <CHARNAME>, marriage is something I have no experience of. I fear I will be a terrible wife! I can't cook, I loathe cleaning, I... I couldn't run a household to save my life! I...~
@5144 = ~(sigh) No, Fade, I would never, ever leave you. However, please, if you don't want to marry me, just say no. Please don't make up poor excuses.~
@5145 = ~Yes... yes, you did, and a most unexpected one at that! I will be honest, it never, ever occurred to me that you might ask me such a thing. The Fey'ri have no need of marriage, and so it is something I have no experience of.~
@5146 = ~To that end, I fear I will be a terrible wife! I can't cook, I loathe cleaning, I... I couldn't run a household to save my life! I...~
@5147 = ~(sigh) Fade, please, if you don't want to marry me, just say no. Please don't make up poor excuses.~
@5148 = ~You would do this, even if I wasn't pregnant by you, <CHARNAME>? This is all rather sudden! Marriage is something I have no experience of. I fear I will be a terrible wife! I can't cook, I loathe cleaning, I... I couldn't run a household to save my life! I...~
@5149 = ~Fade, I don't want to marry you so you can cook or clean for me, nor because I feel an obligation towards you. I want to marry you because I love you! I... I had hoped you would be happy with my proposal.~
@5150 = ~(sigh) Sweetheart, I'm not asking you to do this because I feel I have to! However, please, if you don't want to marry me, just say no. Please don't make up poor excuses.~
@5151 = ~(laugh) Do you honestly think that's why I would ask you to marry me? Because of simple responsibility? I fear you aren't listening to me. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I don't care if you can cook, or whether you hate cleaning... I love you the way you are. Will you marry me?~
@5152 = ~I may be surprised... but I never said I was unhappy with your proposal, <CHARNAME>.~
@5153 = ~(She leans forward and places a kiss on your lips.) I love you more than anything in the Realms. Of course I accept your proposal. I will marry you. (She holds out her left hand to you.)~
@5154 = ~You... you will? You'll marry me? My love, my dear, sweet Fade, you have no idea what this means to me! Let us... let us go and be officiated now! Straight away!~
@5155 = ~(slip the ring onto her finger and kiss her deeply)~
@5156 = ~(slide the ring onto her finger) Thank you for accepting... future Mrs. <CHARNAME>.~
@5157 = ~Ex-excuses? I'm not making excuses! <CHARNAME>, I'd be lying if I said I was expecting this, but as surprises go, this has to be the nicest one ever I've ever had.~
@5158 = ~(Fade initially says nothing, just leans into you and kisses you fervently. During the kiss, you feel her nod and mouth one word--"yes".)~
@5159 = ~(Breaking apart, she smiles at you, and repeats herself.) Yes, I will. I will marry you.~
@5160 = ~(She looks at her hands for a moment, as if unsure what to say. Then she looks up and smiles nervously.)~
@5161 = ~You... you do realise I will be a terrible wife, don't you?  I can't cook, I loathe cleaning, I... I couldn't run a household to save my life! I...~
@5162 = ~And the truth is what you deserve. I have no doubt of that, <CHARNAME>!~
@5163 = ~I fear if you offer me more time, I will think too hard about it and talk myself out of the answer I want to give you, <CHARNAME>. So no, I do not want anymore time.~
@5164 = ~Are... are you sure? I don't want to force you into anything.~
@5165 = ~(Laughing, Fade admires the ring you have placed on her finger.) Whoa! Slow down there, <CHARNAME>! There is no rush, surely? I... I think it is wise that we wait until *after* all this has been cleared up. Because once we are married, I expect your full and undivided attention, all the time...~
@5166 = ~(She cocks an eyebrow at you, and by the wicked grin on her face, she leaves you in no doubt whatsoever what she is referring to...)~
@5167 = ~(She accepts your kiss, wrapping her arms around your neck, pressing her body tightly against yours.)~
@5168 = ~(After a long moment, aware that the others will be wondering what has happened to the two of you, you reluctantly break off the kiss.)~
@5169 = ~(Fade admires the ring you have placed on her finger and gives you a rather covetous smile--one that you know is aimed at you, and not at the bauble you have given her. With a wicked grin, she gives you one last kiss.)~
@5170 = ~Mine! And now the entire world will know. You're not going to escape my clutches that easily!~
@5171 = ~(wink) Heh... no argument there!~
@5172 = ~(grin) I'd *never* want to escape your clutches, my dear... and later on, when we have a little more time to ourselves, I will show you exactly how... deep my devotion is for you.~
@5173 = ~(grin) Who said I want to escape? I'm more than happy in your clutches.~
@5174 = ~(Fade admires the ring you have placed on her finger, reads the inscription on it, and gives you a rather covetous smile--one that you know is aimed at you, and not at the bauble you have given her. With a wicked grin, she gives you one last kiss.)~
@5175 = ~(giggle) Mrs. <CHARNAME>, eh? That is a little... weird... but nice! I could most definitely get used to that!~
@5176 = ~(She then inspects the ring you have placed on her finger, a look of delighted marvel on her face as she allows it to catch the light.)~
@5177 = ~It is... most beautiful, <CHARNAME>. Thank you. For... everything.~
@5178 = ~It is... most beautiful, <CHARNAME>. You even got it engraved! Thank you. For... everything.~
@5179 = ~Of course I'm sure! Once upon a time, you told me not to over-analyse things... and well, I'm not! I'm gong with my gut instinct here, <CHARNAME>. Again, I accept your proposal. I will marry you.~
@5180 = ~My love, my dear, sweet Fade, you have no idea what this means to me! Let us... let us go and be officiated now! Straight away!~
@5181 = ~(slide the ring onto her finger) As long as you're sure... future Mrs. <CHARNAME>.~
@5182 = ~Good... just as long as you are fully aware as to what you are letting yourself in for!~
@5183 = ~(She further inspects the ring you have placed on her finger, a look of delighted marvel on her face as she allows it to catch the light.)~
@5184 = ~Oh, really? Well, I shall certainly look forward to being... worshipped... later.~
@5185 = ~I am most glad to hear that! Just as long as you are fully aware as to what you are letting yourself in for!~
@5186 = ~(sigh) Public announcements never were your forte, huh, <CHARNAME>?~
@5187 = ~What?! You're *pregnant*? Helm's beard, Fade, don't you realise how irresponsible that is?~
@5188 = ~Oh, because this is all *my* fault, isn't it? No one else was involved, were they?~
@5189 = ~(sigh) All right, calm yourself. Indeed, <CHARNAME> is as much involved as you are. But didn't either of you stop to *think* for a moment? Having a child is hard enough as it is without the added weight of <CHARNAME>'s heritage... and yours, for that matter.~
@5190 = ~I know. It was an accident. We... I... never meant this to happen.~
@5191 = ~When is it due?~
@5192 = ~I'm not sure. In a few months' time, I suppose.~
@5193 = ~Then you will indeed need looking after. <CHARNAME> is right--we cannot let you get injured for fear of it harming the child. I know we haven't been the best of friends in the past, but I will look out for you and child from now on. It's the least I can do.~
@5194 = ~Thank you, Anomen.~
@5195 = ~You are... welcome, Fade.~
@5196 = ~A... a baby? That's... good news. But don't you think you both should have waited until after all of this is over?~
@5197 = ~Believe me, Aerie, if I had a choice, I would have. I've not done this on purpose!~
@5198 = ~Well, I suppose these things happen. I noticed you were using a bow more in battle; maybe you should stay near to me in combat so that if you get injured I can get to you quickly.~
@5199 = ~Th-thank you, Aerie.~
@5200 = ~(smile) You are welcome.~
@5201 = ~A *child*?! Of all the stupid things you have done, Fade, this has to take the grand prize! My advice would be to get rid of it or leave. You'll be nothing more than a burden to us now.~
@5202 = ~<CHARNAME>, why did you have to even mention it to this heartless bitch? You must have realised she would never have understood...~
@5203 = ~Heartless? Practical, more like! If you think I am wasting any of my Goddess-given spells on a worthless whore like you just to save your unborn brat, you are *sadly* mistaken.~
@5204 = ~Good! I wouldn't want you or your damn Goddess anywhere near me or my baby anyway!~
@5205 = ~It's so nice when we agree, iblith.~
@5206 = ~So, the circle of life continues, even in these dark times. I will do what I can to help, although if others need it, I must attend to them first. Balance must be preserved.~
@5207 = ~A baby? Isn't that a little irresponsible of you two?~
@5208 = ~A... a child? <CHARNAME>, what were you thinking?~
@5209 = ~Ummm, I don't think I was thinking...~
@5210 = ~I didn't do this on purpose, Jaheira. It was an accident.~
@5211 = ~Jaheira, please. I don't need a lecture; I just need your help.~
@5212 = ~(mutter) That's right, <CHARNAME>, treat me like I'm made of glass again...~
@5213 = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't really think ordering people around like that is possibly the best course of action, I really don't...~
@5214 = ~Hey there, Fade... are you okay? You really do look very tired, and normally you're so full of energy. Are you sickening for something?~
@5215 = ~Condition?! What's he on about, Fade?~
@5216 = ~Plan? What plan? What's he on about now, Fade? Not another crack-pot scheme?~
@5217 = ~Baby... did he just say baby? Fade?~
@5218 = ~I must say, young Fade, you do look quite tired. Are you sure you are well? Do you need any healing?~
@5219 = ~What is wrong with you, child? If you are feeling unwell, you should say. It does not do you any good to keep quiet.~
@5220 = ~Obviously not! A child is a huge responsibility--you can't send it back when the novelty wears off! <CHARNAME>, I can't say this is one of your better decisions, but I will not let the child suffer for the irresponsibility of its parents.~
@5221 = ~IF I see Fade get injured, I will do my best to heal her; although for the sake of group balance, if someone is more grievously injured, they will take precedent. It is only fair.~
@5222 = ~(sigh) Yes, I realise that... but a child is a huge responsibility--you can't send it back when the novelty wears off. <CHARNAME>, I can't say this is one of your better decisions, but I will not let the child suffer for the irresponsibility of its parents.~
@5223 = ~Maybe a lecture is exactly what you *do* need, <CHARNAME>, but it is too late now. A child is a huge responsibility--you can't send it back when the novelty wears off! <CHARNAME>, I can't say this is one of your better decisions, but I will not let the child suffer for the irresponsibility of its parents.~
@5224 = ~A plan? I knew it... plotting from all sides... I warn you, I am prepared!~
@5225 = ~Oooooh--oh oh! Something special you has! Very nice.~
@5226 = ~This blade you be calling Uulia'Moor! Cespenar not see Uulia'Moor for very, very long time. Even smell the same, it does - like sulfur and Cyric's feet!~
@5227 = ~Oooooh! You has Olias-Kin scroll! Old Master wiped his nose with this thing once before! Hmm, seems someone cleaned it. Much better!~
@5228 = ~Cespenar can combine Uulia'Moor and Olias-Kin scroll to make very, very nice blade. Very sharp! Maybe make smell of sulfur stronger, but nothing master can't fix with a few drops of perfume... Cespenar thinks sulfur and lily would be nice!~
@5229 = ~We would need Uulia'Moor sword, Olias-Kin scroll and two eggs. Eggs? Oh, no no no -- wrong recipe. No eggs. Just these two and 7.500 gold pieces. Are you interested?~
@5230 = ~Let's do this.~
@5231 = ~No thank you, not now.~
@5232 = ~No Uulia'Moor work? Okay! Let's check if there's something else here...~
@5233 = ~(shiver) I don't like this place, <CHARNAME>. It calls to me... and it's too much like when we, you know, fought Irenicus.~
@5234 = ~You... you don't talk much about what occurred then, do you? You know you can if you want to--I don't mind.~
@5235 = ~Fade, it's not that I don't want to talk about it--I don't *need* to talk about it. It happened, we triumphed. That is all that matters.~
@5236 = ~To this day, it all seems a bit of a dream to me. I'm not even sure if it was all just a collective hallucination, or if we did indeed die and get drawn to that dreadful place. What do you remember of it?~
@5237 = ~You don't like my pocketplane? Why ever not? Okay, it's not very homely, but it's secure, and we've managed to make a little corner of it comfortable for ourselves.~
@5238 = ~To be honest, I do wonder if Irenicus left something of himself in me when I reclaimed my soul. I... I sometimes feel a little strange--angry for no reason, or disconnected from everyone else. It is a bit unsettling.~
@5239 = ~I sometimes wonder what would have happened had we not triumphed. How would the prophecy have been affected? Would Irenicus have been bound to it as I seem to be?~
@5240 = ~It calls to you? What do you mean by that?~
@5241 = ~But... but... he took your *soul*! I know you defeated him and it is all in the past, but our past shapes who we are now. Surely it all left some kind of impression upon you?~
@5242 = ~Maybe it did, maybe it didn't. I think you would be a better judge of that--you're with me most of the time, you know me better than anyone here... well, perhaps with the exception of Imoen. Have I changed?~
@5243 = ~Maybe it did, maybe it didn't. I think you would be a better judge of that--you're with me most of the time, you know me better than anyone here. Have I changed?~
@5244 = ~Of course it did! I now take things a little more seriously than I once did, but that's as much because of you and our relationship as everything else. Irenicus took my soul; you've taken my heart. Whether I like it or not, I'm a different person now. There's no point dissecting and analysing it--it's much better to just get on with it all and try not to worry too much.~
@5245 = ~Of course it did. I know how powerful Irenicus was, and in defeating him, how powerful I have become. Hence why I do not need to talk about it; I am fully aware of what I am. No amount of discussion is going to change it, so why bother?~
@5246 = ~(shudder) I remember enough. My memories are more of feelings and... yearnings than of any actual events. You were tested; I remember that much. It seems the more time we put between then and now, the hazier the memories become. Whether that is by design or just our mortal way of coping with such an experience, I don't know.~
@5247 = ~I remember the trials--only vaguely, though. Something about "tears"? I know Sarevok was there... odd how I remember that clearly. And Irenicus--I remember him clearly. Still, he's defeated now, so there's no point sitting and analysing it all. It happened and we triumphed. I suppose that is all that matters.~
@5248 = ~Either way, I don't think it matters much. Better to forget the horrors of that place in the long run, although maybe not the lessons learnt there.~
@5249 = ~I don't know either. You know, I sometimes wonder what would have happened had we not triumphed. How would the prophecy have been affected? Would Irenicus have been bound to it as I seem to be?~
@5250 = ~Our corner is fine, <CHARNAME>. But you have to remember, this is an *abyssal* pocketplane, and whether I like it or not, I have blood-ties to that Plane.~
@5251 = ~Oh... I see. I have to admit, I hadn't considered that. Are you okay? I would say we could leave immediately and never come back, but I don't think that's possible.~
@5252 = ~Yes, I have considered that. I had hoped that your blood-tie would mean nothing more than a little bit of irritability on your part, but then I remember your reaction in the Underdark...~
@5253 = ~I don't think that is Irenicus' influence, <CHARNAME>. I am more inclined to believe that is down to your own heritage. The Prophecy is coming to fruition and your, err, "Father" created this near-army of Bhaalspawn to give him life once again, didn't he? Maybe that has more to do with it than anything else.~
@5254 = ~Are you saying what I think you're saying? You think that this is Bhaal's influence on me? And not just the taint, but actually Bhaal himself? That's ridiculous! He's *dead*, Fade. He's the *dead* God of Murder, not the "sleeping" or "laying low for a while" God of Murder!~
@5255 = ~That's a little... disconcerting. I sincerely hope you're wrong. I think I'd actually prefer the lingering taint of Irenicus on my soul than that.~
@5256 = ~Maybe you're right. Maybe all of the slain Bhaalspawn are returning to my... father. Maybe he *is* gaining in strength, and it is in turn influencing me.~
@5257 = ~I have to say, that has never even crossed my mind. He obviously targeted you because that part of your soul is immortal, I suppose...~
@5258 = ~Does that mean *you're* immortal? Maybe that's the true reason Irenicus targeted you... maybe it had nothing to do with Bhaal at all. Maybe we *did* all die, only you truly can't, and that is why we had to fight, or... or something like that...~
@5259 = ~Or maybe someone is over-thinking the whole situation? I honestly don't know what my heritage means in terms of my own mortality and I personally think it is futile at the moment to try to puzzle it out. All you'll end up with is a headache!~
@5260 = ~I have to admit, it's crossed my mind a lot. All of this just makes me realise that I don't know myself very well. Indeed, what part of me is tied to this Prophecy? Is it myself as a whole, or just the tainted part? I sometimes find it hard to separate <CHARNAME> the <RACE> from <CHARNAME> the Child of Prophecy.~
@5261 = ~Having been close to death a number of times, I doubt that I am immortal. Irenicus wanted a soul--a powerful soul, granted, one that had a spark of "divinity" in it--but an immortal one? Surely there are more powerful souls out there. Granted, such things would have proven a greater challenge than a young Bhaalspawn at the time, but Irenicus' arrogance knew no bounds. Look at what he tried to do to the Seldarine!~
@5262 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm part Tanar'ri. The Abyss is my racial home. I have blood-ties to this Plane.~
@5263 = ~You're not going to go crazy on me, are you? Because I want to be as far away as possible if you are.~
@5264 = ~Well...~
@5265 = ~Fade, be honest. How have I changed?~
@5266 = ~Well, I suppose I can take from your response that I *have* changed, even if I haven't realised it.~
@5267 = ~So, I have changed. I see. Has it ever crossed your mind that having your soul stolen from you may do that to a person?~
@5268 = ~I'm not sure I like having our relationship compared in any way to what Irenicus did to you, but I do take your point. I just don't want you bottling anything up.~
@5269 = ~What, like the way you do? Big, strong male here, Fade! I have my way of coping and you have yours. No need to fret.~
@5270 = ~My love, I'm not bottling anything up, honestly! Irenicus is defeated, I have what is rightfully mine back, everything is as it should be. Well, possibly not everything, considering this whole "frying pan and fire" situation we've landed ourselves in, but you get the picture. I'm fine!~
@5271 = ~I'm fine, Fade, although I do sometimes wonder what would have happened had we not triumphed. How would the prophecy have been affected? Would Irenicus have been bound to it as I seem to be?~
@5272 = ~Uh, <CHARNAME>? Are you all right? I didn't mean to upset you.~
@5273 = ~You haven't upset me, Fade. I've been thinking for some while now about what I am... about what I may become. All of this just makes me realise that I don't know myself very well. Indeed, what part of me is tied to this Prophecy? Is it myself as a whole, or just the tainted part? I sometimes find it hard to separate <CHARNAME> the <RACE> from <CHARNAME> the Child of Prophecy.~
@5274 = ~It's okay... I'm fine. You're just mirroring some of my own thoughts. To be honest, I do wonder if Irenicus left something of himself in me when I reclaimed my soul. I... I sometimes feel a little strange--angry for no reason, or disconnected from everyone else. It is a bit unsettling.~
@5275 = ~Fade, I'm fine. I know I have changed over the course of our adventures, but then that was inevitable. Someone once said "With great power comes great responsibility." I am aware of my responsibilities now, that's all.~
@5276 = ~That is indeed good advice... if I ever remember what the lessons were actually about! (shiver) I don't like this place... it calls to me.~
@5277 = ~I realise that. I just wanted to warn you that if I do end up snapping at you or going weird on you for no reason, you know exactly why. It's the little bit of me labelled "demon" that's responsible for it, and I'll inevitably not mean whatever I am doing or saying at that point, okay?~
@5278 = ~Okay, I'll bear that in mind. As long as you don't go on some weird, demonic-inspired massacre, everything should be okay. (grin)~
@5279 = ~Are you sure you're okay? Even now you seem a little... uptight.  Maybe we should only use this place in emergencies.~
@5280 = ~(wink) Well, feel free to let your succubus side have a field day.~
@5281 = ~(blush) I'd like to *forget* that incident, thank you very much <CHARNAME>. That was not one of my finest moments.~
@5282 = ~I just wanted to warn you that if I do end up snapping at you or going weird on you for no reason, you know exactly why. It's the little bit of me labelled "demon" that's responsible for it, and I'll inevitably not mean whatever I am doing or saying at that point, okay?~
@5283 = ~Whoa, easy there! I hope you're right--I hope that Bhaal has no further influence over you, other than your heritage by means of your unusual birth. But... well, look around you.~
@5284 = ~This didn't get conjured up from thin air; this is yours, tailor-made for *you*. You've even inherited that obnoxious Imp.~
@5285 = ~I hate to say this, but Bhaal's taint is strong in you. Whether you like it or not, murder is a huge part of your life, and people fear you because of it. Now how much of that is <CHARNAME>, and how much is Bhaal's strengthening influence over you, I don't know, but I guess we won't have to wait too long to find out.~
@5286 = ~I hate to say this, but Bhaal's taint is strong in you. I know you don't like it and that you fight your instincts, but murder is a huge part of your life. Now how much of that is <CHARNAME>, and how much is Bhaal's strengthening influence over you, I don't know, but I guess we won't have to wait too long to find out.~
@5287 = ~I don't think you have much of a choice, <CHARNAME>. The reasons behind your own growth in power may not be aligned with your dead sire. It may all be a coincidence... but then why do you have this pocketplane? Why not any of the other Bhaalspawn? You've even inherited that obnoxious Imp!~
@5288 = ~What will happen if Bhaal gets all of his taint back, if all the dead souls of his Children are re-united within him? I... maybe... you... I...~
@5289 = ~I know. You don't have to say any more. I... I hope it doesn't come to that, I really do. Best not to try to think about it.~
@5290 = ~Fade, that won't happen, at least not without a bloody good fight. Even if I have to stand before Bhaal himself.~
@5291 = ~What are you blathering on about? Pull yourself together, woman! I am what I am through hard graft and experience. Sure, my heritage has given me the edge, but all of this is *my* doing, not Bhaal's.~
@5292 = ~Maybe. I wonder what will happen if Bhaal gets all of his taint back, if all the dead souls of his Children are re-united within him? I... maybe... you... I...~
@5293 = ~True, but I can't help but wonder and worry, just a little bit. Part of me likes the thought of you being immortal--it means we'll never be apart... but that is very selfish of me. I suppose all we can do is play out the parts intended for us and see what happens.~
@5294 = ~I can understand why you might feel that way, but you are the most genuine person I have ever met--you are most definitely *you*! And whatever it is that ties you to this Prophecy is obviously fundamental to who you are... just look around you. This didn't get conjured up from thin air.~
@5295 = ~I have to admit that all of this confuses me beyond belief. I desperately want to understand what you're all about, but the more I try to understand you, the more confused I get.~
@5296 = ~That is true... and since his end intention was to assault the Tree again anyway, the soul of a wandering Bhaalspawn was easily the most convenient target for him. I bet he's regretting that choice, wherever he ended up!~
@5297 = ~I suppose I do owe Irenicus some kind of gratitude, though. If he hadn't have come after you, there would have been no reason for you to come to Athkatla and we would never have met. Strange how Fate works... how good things seem to come from misery.~
@5298 = ~I suppose this could all be part of that "balance" rubbish Jaheira keeps banging on about. Not that I care. As long as we're together, things can't be all that bad.~
@5299 = ~I suppose this could all be part of that "balance" rubbish Cernd keeps banging on about. Not that I care. As long as we're together, things can't be all that bad.~
@5300 = ~Never fear, <CHARNAME>! Seriously, though, I just wanted to warn you that if I do end up snapping at you or going weird on you for no reason, you know exactly why; it's the little bit of me labelled "demon" that's responsible for it, and I'll inevitably not mean whatever I am doing or saying at that point, okay?~
@5301 = ~You're definitely more confident than you were. I don't know, more... well, mature is a bit strong a word for it, just a bit... different. Maybe you always were like this, but as we've gotten closer, I've only just realised.~
@5302 = ~People are willing to die for you, <CHARNAME>. They are willing to fight for your cause no matter what, simply on your strength of character. I know I would. Even if I were not your lover, I would still gladly put my life in your hands. Me, a Fey'ri, willing to die for another.~
@5303 = ~I mean no arrogance in what I say, but I don't know if you realise how unique that makes you. We Fey'ri die for nobody other than ourselves--not even to save our own flesh and blood. But you... I, a full-blooded Fey'ri, would do anything for.~
@5304 = ~Normally to admit such a thing would bring one of my kind nothing but shame, but I am *proud* to feel this way.~
@5305 = ~Yes, you have. You're definitely more confident than you were. I don't know, more... well, mature is a bit strong a word for it, just a bit... different. Maybe you always were like this, but as we've gotten closer, I've only just realised.~
@5306 = ~<CHARNAME>, I never meant any insult to you! And I am not implying that you've changed for the worse. You're definitely more confident than you were. I don't know, more... well, mature is a bit strong a word for it, just a bit... different. Maybe you always were like this, but as we've gotten closer, I've only just realised.~
@5307 = ~I really hope that was a poor attempt at levity, because I'm not in the mood to be your "little woman" right now, <CHARNAME>.~
@5308 = ~Oh, Fade, is this place really getting to you that much? Any other time and you'd be laughing at me right now.~
@5309 = ~Err, okay, I was joking, but I can see you're not in the mood for jokes right now, so I'll, umm, go over there for a while before I *really* stick my foot in it and say something you disembowel me for, all right?~
@5310 = ~Oh, all right. Sorry, my love. And no, I am not bottling anything up, honestly! Irenicus is defeated, I have what is rightfully mine back, everything is as it should be. Well, possibly not *everything*, considering this whole "frying pan and fire" situation we've landed ourselves in, but you get the picture. I'm fine!~
@5311 = ~Okay, as long as you're sure.~
@5312 = ~(She gives you a long look. There is no doubt in your mind that she doesn't believe you, but before you can answer her, she turns from you and leaves.)~
@5313 = ~Whoever said that was a wise person. You are indeed powerful, and therefore you have some overwhelming responsibilities.~
@5314 = ~Under normal circumstances, I'd be laughing with you, but here... don't even joke about it, <CHARNAME>. I'm sure nothing will happen, but I have to warn you, just in case. This place isn't good for me.~
@5315 = ~That might be wise. I understand that this place is part of your destiny, but for every superfluous second we remain here... I begin to remember how *good* chaos and gratuitous violence felt.~
@5316 = ~Not that I'd give in, but the temptation is enough to make me a little, shall we say, "crotchety"?~
@5317 = ~*Not* appropriate, <CHARNAME>. People think physical gratification is what a succubus is all about. I've seen the aftermath of a succubus' playtime... I've had to clear away the "bits" too, so don't even joke about it.~
@5318 = ~I'm sure nothing will happen, but I have to warn you, just in case. This place isn't good for me.~
@5319 = ~(Fade just nods and holds you tightly, as if she is afraid you will be dragged from her as you speak. After a long while, she releases you.)~
@5320 = ~I don't know what I would do if you were taken from me, <CHARNAME>. Whatever happens, whenever it occurs--we face it together.~
@5321 = ~(shiver) I don't like this place--it reminds me too much of home. I shall be glad when we are out on the road again.~
@5322 = ~And I will be there, by your side! Bhaal is *not* going to have you!~
@5323 = ~(She lunges towards you and holds you tightly, as if she is afraid you will be dragged from her as you speak. After a long while, she releases you.)~
@5324 = ~Even though that is quite possibly the most arrogant thing I have *ever* heard you say, I hope you are right.~
@5325 = ~(She grabs you by the collar and drags your face near hers.) But if you *ever* talk to me in that tone again, I'll disembowel you where you stand. Got it?~
@5326 = ~I know this place doesn't agree with you and makes you twitchy, so I'm going to pretend you didn't say that, Fade. Just don't to it again. Or else.~
@5327 = ~Fade, my love, calm down. I know this is the Abyss talking, not you, and I don't want you to say, or do, anything you might regret later, okay?~
@5328 = ~Yes, it is. I understand that this place is part of your destiny, but for every superfluous second we remain here... I begin to remember how *good* chaos and gratuitous violence felt.~
@5329 = ~Normally I would beg you to stay by my side, but right now I feel that is probably for the best.~
@5330 = ~I understand that this place is part of your destiny, but for every superfluous second we remain here... I begin to remember how *good* chaos and gratuitous violence felt.~
@5331 = ~(She releases you as if burnt.) <CHARNAME>! I'm... I'm sorry... it's this damnable place! Every superfluous second we remain here, I begin to remember how *good* chaos and gratuitous violence felt!~
@5332 = ~Just... leave me be for a while. I'll be fine.~
@5333 = ~Or else what, <CHARNAME>? What would you do to me to punish me for such threats?~
@5334 = ~(She runs a finger along her collarbone and traces it down the curve of her cleavage.) Maybe a little "game" is in order...~
@5335 = ~(Her tail begins to lash slowly as she takes a step towards you. Suddenly she pulls herself up short and shakes her head violently.) NO! Just... get away from me! Oh, gods, I HATE this place!~
@5336 = ~(She looks at you, her crimson eyes wild with conflicting emotion.) I need some time to compose myself. I... I'm sorry. I'll speak to you later.~
@5337 = ~How *dare* that... that despicable, loathsome ghost sully the memory of Keita! How DARE it!~
@5338 = ~(She falls to her knees and begins to sob.) Oh, Keita... Keita... please not let it have ended that way. Forever will I now be haunted by the fact that I could have saved you!~
@5339 = ~Fade, the Wraith was lying. It was a trick--and as mean, low down and dirty as it was, it was still just a trick. It was meant to upset and unbalance you. Try to see past it.~
@5340 = ~You cannot believe a word that... that fiend said! Look at the awful things it said when purporting to be Gorion. Yes, it hurts, but it is naught but lies.~
@5341 = ~My love, whatever happened to Keita--however she met her end--it was not your fault. The Wraith has done you a cruel disservice dredging all this up, but it is now defeated, and once again you can consign your past to where it belongs--the past. We have to look to the future now.~
@5342 = ~How could it be a trick? It knew... it knew what happened. My greatest fear was that... that she had been recaptured. If only I hadn't been dissuaded from my intended path! I intended to rescue her... I only didn't because I was told it was too late...~
@5343 = ~The chances are it was too late. Fade, do you not see what the Wraith was doing? It was tapping into our deepest fears and using them against us. Gorion would never have spoken to me thusly, and I know from what you have told me, Keita would never have wanted you to suffer.~
@5344 = ~Please, my love, whatever happened to Keita--however she met her end--it was not your fault. The Wraith has done you a cruel disservice dredging all this up, but it is now defeated, and once again you can consign your past to where it belongs--the past. We have to look to the future now.~
@5345 = ~Try to see through the lies. Keita would never have wanted to hurt you this way. From all you have told me, she loved you just as much as you loved her.~
@5346 = ~You only have the Wraith's word that is what happened. It is more than likely that it plucked the memory of Keita from your own recollections and moulded her... its... reactions from your own fears. I know that its reaction to me when it was in the guise of Gorion was a direct mirror of my own worries and fears.~
@5347 = ~How can you be so certain, <CHARNAME>? It spoke the truth as to what happened... it knew! How did it know so much if it wasn't connected to... to... her? My greatest fear was that... that she had been recaptured. And now I know that is indeed what happened!~
@5348 = ~That Wraith was pure evil--you cannot believe a word it said! It tapped into your greatest fears and used them against you. Try to see past the lies. This is exactly the response it wanted from you!~
@5349 = ~Fade, it was all lies! Keita would never have wanted to hurt you this way. From all you have told me, she loved you just as much as you loved her.~
@5350 = ~I know... I know I must not dwell on the past, but each time I think I am over it and that I can move on, something happens to drag me back to that time! The slavers' last attempt to kidnap me... seeing my family again... the nightmares... my feelings for you...~
@5351 = ~I do not want to forget Keita, as I have said before, but I just wish her memory brought me peace and happiness rather than such pain!~
@5352 = ~What you went through was horrific, and no matter how much you wish it otherwise, Keita's memory will always be bittersweet for you. But with time it will get easier. The Wraith has dredged up the worst of your fears and presented them to you using Keita's face--its entire goal was to make you feel this way.~
@5353 = ~Your feelings for me make you feel... bad? I... I do not understand!~
@5354 = ~I know it is hard, but this is exactly how the Wraith wanted to make you feel. It is more than likely that it plucked the memory of Keita from your own recollections and moulded her... its... reactions from your own fears. I know that its reaction to me when it was in the guise of Gorion was a direct mirror of my own worries and fears.~
@5355 = ~I know exactly how you feel, I really do. Those things Gorion said mirrored my own deepest fears. Foul spectre! If only I could make it pay twice over for what it has done to us.~
@5356 = ~You... you speak the truth. Why would our loved ones want to hurt us, even from beyond the grave? Damn that Spectre! How dare it use Keita! Wasn't she used enough in life that her memory should be abused in such a way?~
@5357 = ~Every time I think I can remember her without some measure of pain, something happens... something makes the pain flood back tenfold! The slavers' last attempt to kidnap me... seeing my family again... the nightmares... my feelings for you...~
@5358 = ~She did indeed love me... and I abandoned her in her hour of direst need! Do you not understand, <CHARNAME>? If only I had gone back, she might... she might still be alive today.~
@5359 = ~You cannot live your life on "ifs" and 'maybes', Fade! I know it is hard, but this is exactly how the Wraith wanted to make you feel. It is more than likely that it plucked the memory of Keita from your own recollections and moulded her... its... reactions from your own fears. I know that its reaction to me when it was in the guise of Gorion was a direct mirror of my own worries and fears.~
@5360 = ~Of course I understand. If I had only been stronger, I could have saved Gorion from his fate. But it is in the past now--there is nothing, absolutely nothing we can do about it. My love, these people are now dead, beyond our help. We cannot dwell on their fates, for it will only destroy us in the long run.~
@5361 = ~I know deep down that you... you speak the truth. Why would our loved ones want to hurt us, even from beyond the grave? Damn that Spectre! How dare it use Keita! Wasn't she used enough in life that her memory should be abused in such a way?~
@5362 = ~(Fade looks to you and pulls you to her in a rough embrace.) Oh, <CHARNAME>... I was so intent on my own vision that I never stopped to consider how this must make you feel!~
@5363 = ~This is indeed a horrible situation to be in... let us put it all behind us now. Keita and Gorion are dead, and as much as we loved them in life, they must not hold us back in death. It is not what they would have wanted at all.~
@5364 = ~Wise words, Fade. Sometimes you can quite the little philosopher! Let us not let the past cast a shadow over our future together.~
@5365 = ~They are indeed dead, and nothing we can do will change that. That is why I invest everything I have into you now, my dearest Fade. With time, we will be fine; of that I am sure.~
@5366 = ~Exactly. I know Gorion would only have wanted me to be happy, and for that Wraith to suggest otherwise is... is despicable. Let us put it behind us as quickly as possible and remember our loved ones as they deserve.~
@5367 = ~I know... I can see that now. I... I overreacted again, and for that I am sorry. I should not let the past have such a hold over me, and I certainly should not burden you with it all.~
@5368 = ~Hopefully there will come a time when Keita is not such a touchy subject with me. I had hoped that time had already come, but obviously not.~
@5369 = ~That time will come, of that I am sure. You will be able to remember Keita the person with affection rather than pain.~
@5370 = ~You ask too much of yourself so soon after such a shock, although I know exactly how you feel. The things Gorion said mirrored my own deepest fears. Foul Shade! If only I could make it pay twice over for what it has done to us.~
@5371 = ~Your fears are not a burden to me, Fade. Together we have faced a lot, and we will continue to do so. If anything I feel... well, not happy, but certainly some level of contentment that you do feel you can share these fears with me, and that I can do the same with you.~
@5372 = ~<CHARNAME>, I did not intend that to sound as negative as it did. I only mean that you have captured my heart in such a way... sometimes what we have is so all consuming, I forget all else, including Keita. Then her memory looms again, and I feel... guilty for having near forgotten her.~
@5373 = ~Your fears are groundless. I know you will never forget her, not completely. This is time's simple way of helping you heal. You should not feel bad about feeling happy.~
@5374 = ~I cannot pretend I am not pleased to hear you speak of our love like that, but I doubt I ever could totally replace Keita in your heart. Not that I'd want to, either. She was special to you, and she should remain like that for ever.~
@5375 = ~Agreed. We must build on what we have, and try our hardest not let the past come between us, ever.~
@5376 = ~(She smiles at you, but her eyes betray that she is still troubled. Before you can question her, she kisses your cheek and moves away from you.)~
@5377 = ~Come... we have tarried here long enough, and we have a lot to accomplish.~
@5378 = ~Your optimism does you credit, <CHARNAME>... and once again, I hope you are right. The shadows of the past should not--must not!--intrude on what we have together, for what we share is a rare and beautiful thing.~
@5379 = ~Yes, both Gorion and Keita deserve to be remembered with love and respect, not fear and loathing. We must ensure that this... situation does not defile our feelings towards them, or to each other. The shadows of the past should not--must not!--intrude on what we have together.~
@5380 = ~I hope so. I would hate to see what we have poisoned by my inability to bury the ghosts from my past. I promise that I will try harder in the future... in our future. I realise now that the shadows of the past must not intrude on what we have together.~
@5381 = ~A trouble shared is a trouble halved, eh? Life would indeed be easier for us if we both came with a clean slate--that is for sure! But I am also glad you feel you can speak to me of such things... it proves what we have can weather all that is thrown at it.~
@5382 = ~I know... I should not feel guilty about loving you--I should be proud and happy to have you by my side! How I despise this situation! Why did that awful Wraith have to do this to us now? What we share is as rare as it is beautiful, and we must not let the shadows of the past intrude on what we have together.~
@5383 = ~Thank you for understanding that, <CHARNAME>. I know you are not in competition with Keita, but sometimes it is so hard to stop feeling that way. The last thing I needed was that awful Wraith playing on my guilt and fears... but I suppose that was its intention all along, wasn't it?~
@5384 = ~(Ever since the Wraith attack on your party, Fade has seemed a little subdued, seemingly lost in thought a lot of the time and only speaking when spoken to.)~
@5385 = ~My love, is there something still bothering you? You have been so quiet of late--it is most unlike you!~
@5386 = ~What's up, honeykitten? It feels like a huge gulf has opened up between us. I haven't done anything wrong, have I?~
@5387 = ~Fade, would you like to rest a while? You look quite tired.~
@5388 = ~It is nothing for you to worry about. I have just been thinking a lot of late, that is all. (She smiles at you, but it seems a little forced.)~
@5389 = ~Well, a copper for those thoughts? Maybe we could work out what's bothering you between the both of us?~
@5390 = ~You're not fooling anyone, Fade. I *know* something is bothering you. Come on, out with it! (smile)~
@5391 = ~Well, as long as you're sure...~
@5392 = ~Of course you haven't done anything wrong! I've just had a lot to think about recently, that's all. Nothing for you to be concerned about. (She smiles at you, but it seems a little forced.)~
@5393 = ~I'll decide what I should and shouldn't be concerned about if that's okay, Fade, and right now, your distance from me is one of those things. Please... tell me what's wrong.~
@5394 = ~No, thank you. I'm not that tired. But thank you for your concern. (She smiles, but it does not reach her eyes.)~
@5395 = ~Fade, why are you being so formal with me? It's me, <CHARNAME>. Is there something wrong?~
@5396 = ~My love, have I done something wrong? You are being so distant at the moment, and it worries me.~
@5397 = ~Ever since we dealt with the Wraith, you have been like this. Is it that battle that still bothers you? Or something else?~
@5398 = ~Like I said, it's nothing. (sigh) Okay, so I've been thinking about that damn Wraith and what it said to us. I know I said I wouldn't dwell on it, but it's so hard not to.~
@5399 = ~My love, I thought we had sorted all this out? I know you will always have feelings for Keita, but your brooding over her fate does her memory no favour.~
@5400 = ~Oh. I see. I thought we had sorted this out... but nonetheless, if it is still bothering you, perhaps we should discuss it.~
@5401 = ~I know... I have been too. It's hard to forget the vile things the memories of our loved ones were made to say.~
@5402 = ~I can't keep anything from you, can I? (grin) It's almost as if you can read my innermost thoughts, sometimes.~
@5403 = ~Well... not really. I may know something is wrong, but that's the extent of my powers! (grin)~
@5404 = ~It's good to see you smile again, Fade. I was getting a little worried. You have been so withdrawn recently.~
@5405 = ~Heh heh... oh, how I wish I could! Then I would know *exactly* what you think of me, especially when we... well... you know... (wink)~
@5406 = ~Yes, of course I'm sure.~
@5407 = ~Well... okay, there is one thing. When the Wraith faced you as Gorion... what did you think at first? You seemed so... unfazed by it all after the battle. I know you tend to cope better with these things than I do, but it must have been a shock... mustn't it?~
@5408 = ~A shock? Sure it was, for a moment. But I supposed I realised pretty quickly that Gorion never spoke to me like that when he was alive--why would he in death?~
@5409 = ~I don't know about my ability to cope better; I think I'm just better at hiding my emotions. I've thought long and hard about what the Wraith said when it was masquerading as Gorion... and it has played on my mind a little. Maybe it did have a point.~
@5410 = ~No, not really. I saw through the illusion straight away. Gorion would never have said anything like that to me, ever.~
@5411 = ~I've been distant with you? I'm sorry... that was not my intention at all. I've just been thinking...~
@5412 = ~(sigh) Okay, so I've been thinking about that damn Wraith and what it said to us. I know I said I wouldn't dwell on it, but it's so hard not to.~
@5413 = ~What? Formal? Sorry, <CHARNAME>... I've just had things on my mind recently, nothing more. It's nothing for you to be concerned about.~
@5414 = ~(Fade smiles at you and looks a little guilty.) I can't get anything past you, can I? Okay, so I've been thinking about that damn Wraith and what it said to us. I know I said I wouldn't dwell on it, but it's so hard not to.~
@5415 = ~I know--I wasn't actually thinking about Keita. Well, not much. I have actually been thinking about you, and what the Wraith Gorion said to you.~
@5416 = ~You've been thinking about what was said to *me*? Why in the Realms would you want to do that?~
@5417 = ~I see. So... what the Wraith said as Gorion bothers you?~
@5418 = ~The Wraith put lies into the mouth of my memories of Gorion--I thought we had established this. It's not worth worrying about!~
@5419 = ~You don't seem all that keen, <CHARNAME>.~
@5420 = ~(sigh) It's not that. I had just hoped we wouldn't have to keep revisiting this subject over and over again, that's all.~
@5421 = ~I had just thought we had this sorted out. I know you will always have feelings for Keita, but your brooding over her fate does her memory no favour.~
@5422 = ~Well... I'm not. I want to put that whole episode behind me, and it doesn't help that you keep dragging it up again. Why can't you let it rest?~
@5423 = ~Yes, it is. However, I have made how I feel about what happened clear. You, on the other hand, are the one who has been cagey.~
@5424 = ~It may surprise you, but I haven't really been thinking about what Keita said at all. I have actually been thinking about you, and what the Wraith Gorion said to you.~
@5425 = ~I haven't been "cagey". The Wraith put lies into the mouth of my memories of Gorion--I thought we had established this. It's not worth worrying about!~
@5426 = ~It is funny you should say that, because I suppose that is a small part of what I have been thinking about recently. Ever since the Wraith spoke to you in the guise of Gorion...~
@5427 = ~What? I was joking, Fade! What in the Realms are you on about?~
@5428 = ~You've been thinking about that again? The Wraith put lies into the mouth of my memories of Gorion--I thought we had established this. It's not worth worrying about!~
@5429 = ~I've suppose I have been a little withdrawn... and I'm sorry for that. I've just been thinking...~
@5430 = ~(snigger) 'm a little offended, <CHARNAME>. Surely you don't need to read my mind to know what I'm thinking in those, uh, particular "moments"...~
@5431 = ~(grin) Now *this* is more like the Fade I know! So... are you going to tell me what's been bothering you or not?~
@5432 = ~I suppose that's true. As they say, actions do indeed speak louder than words...~
@5433 = ~Of course not! Just teasing you, and trying to lighten the mood a little. You've been so distant from me recently... I was getting worried.~
@5434 = ~Indeed... why should he. But... don't you think what he... it... had to say was a little bit worrying? The inference that you were "supposed to be much more", and that your personal battles are nothing more than a reflection of your heritage...~
@5435 = ~I will admit, <CHARNAME>, even though we have spoken much of your heritage in the past, I never really stopped to consider the repercussions of it. That's what I am somewhat concerned about.~
@5436 = ~What are you going on about? We've had to face the implications and repercussions of my heritage over and over again--why do you think Irenicus was after me in the first place?~
@5437 = ~I don't think I really understand what you mean, Fade. the Wraith was a lie; it plucked my own fears out of my mind and repeated them back to me, hoping to upset and destabilize me. Since I realise that, what it said has no merit, so there is still nothing to be concerned about.~
@5438 = ~I suppose I can relate to that. Even thought it was not the real Gorion who spoke to me, the Wraith's words did have some merit. I dislike this feeling of being a puppet on a string, especially when I don't know who is holding the aforementioned string. However, if I am indeed the Child of the prophecy, it would seem I have no choice in the matter. Whatever I do seems to have been pre-ordained, or so it seems.~
@5439 = ~You may not have stopped previously to consider the repercussions of my heritage, but I have. I know what a lot of this means, Fade. Please, let me do the worrying for the both of us--it's not worth both us losing sleep over.~
@5440 = ~That is what I thought, too. As much as I don't like to admit it and as much as I'd like to discount all it said, I just can't. Even though we have spoken much of your heritage in the past, I never really stopped previously to consider the repercussions of it. That's what I am concerned about.~
@5441 = ~I see. Are you saying that you... regret our relationship? Life would be so much easier for you if you didn't have me to worry about.~
@5442 = ~I know I, you know, lost it before, with the Slayer and everything... but I promise you, since we defeated Irenicus I have been so much stronger. I am not about to tear you all to little pieces, if that is your main concern.~
@5443 = ~Gorion may not have said anything like that to you in the past, but the Wraith got the information from somewhere! Did... did you not think it may have had a small point?~
@5444 = ~As a party of comrades, we are so used to you being a Bhaalspawn... even whilst we pursued Irenicus, I did not for one moment consider the actual implications and repercussions of your heritage. Didn't the Wraith even make you consider these things?~
@5445 = ~What rubbish are you talking now?! The Wraith was there to destabilise and upset me--nothing more! I really think you are seeing far too much into this encounter, I really do.~
@5446 = ~I suppose so. Even thought it was not the real Gorion who spoke to me, the Wraith's words did have some merit. I dislike this feeling of being a puppet on a string, especially when I don't know who is holding the aforementioned string. However, if I am indeed the Child of the prophecy, it would seem I have no choice in the matter. Whatever I do seems to have been pre-ordained, or so it seems.~
@5447 = ~Implications and repercussions? You're referring to Alaundo's Prophecy, aren't you? Fade, I really don't think you need to concern yourself with it too much! Please, let me do the worrying for the both of us--it's not worth both us losing sleep over.~
@5448 = ~Of course I have. The inference that you were "supposed to be much more" and that your personal battles are nothing more than a reflection of your heritage...~
@5449 = ~Not so much bothered me... it just more made me think. As much as I don't like to admit it and as much as I'd like to discount all it said, I just can't. Even though we have spoken much of your heritage in the past, I never really stopped previously to consider the repercussions of it. That's what I am concerned about.~
@5450 = ~I know you may think I am being silly over it all, but please... hear me out. Gorion may not have said anything like that to you in the past, but the Wraith got the information from somewhere! Did... did you not think it may have had a small point?~
@5451 = ~I assume from that comment you believe I've been thinking Keita. Well, this may come as a surprise you, but I haven't really been thinking about what she said at all.~
@5452 = ~I have actually been thinking about you, and what the Wraith Gorion said to you. I have made how I feel about what happened clear. You, on the other hand, are the one who has been cagey.~
@5453 = ~Let it *rest*? How can I let it rest?! Haven't you at all considered the words of the Wraith in its guise as Gorion?~
@5454 = ~As much as I don't like to admit it and as much as I'd like to discount all it said... I just can't. Even though we have spoken much of your heritage in the past, I never really stopped previously to consider the repercussions of it. That's what I am concerned about.~
@5455 = ~Because what was said doesn't just affect you! Your constant argument that Gorion may not have said anything like that to you in the past may be true, but the Wraith got the information from somewhere! Did... did you not think it may have had a small point?~
@5456 = ~(Pursing her lips, obviously trying not to grin, Fade rolls her eyes at you and waggles a finger at you in mock admonishment.) I've said it before and I'll say it again... you are *terrible*!~
@5457 = ~(sigh) However, there is something we need to discuss, I suppose. Ever since we faced the Wraith and our... our loved ones, I have been thinking about you, and what the Wraith Gorion said to you. I have made how I feel about what happened clear. You, on the other hand, have been quite cagey about it.~
@5458 = ~I don't know. All the time Irenicus was after you, it was personal. Yes, he wanted you because of your divine heritage, but his ultimate goal was to further his own ends, which meant our ultimate goal was to simply defeat him.~
@5459 = ~The Wraith disguised as Gorion referred however to the Prophecy. I never once in the past stopped to think about your part in all of it, and it has only just recently just struck me how huge all this is. I... I'm afraid, <CHARNAME>, afraid that all of this is going to end up tearing us apart...~
@5460 = ~Tearing us apart? Fade, please do not speak of such things! You are the one who helps me keep going. Without you, my life would be an empty, hollow thing indeed.~
@5461 = ~I cannot pretend that I haven't thought along the same lines as you about all this, but since we are both aware of the danger, we should be able to fight it, and fight for what we have. I'm certainly not going to give you up because of some stupid Prophecy!~
@5462 = ~What are you saying? Do you... want us to be torn apart? Is this getting to be too much for you?~
@5463 = ~But don't you see? Don't you realise? What the Wraith said had to have come from somewhere! It's okay for you to say that you realise Gorion would never speak to you in such a way... but those fears must have been lurking inside you for the Wraith to have used them against you in the first place. And that is probably even more worrying than if it had actually been Gorion criticising you!~
@5464 = ~What? Fade, I really, really think you need to calm down! Now I *know* you are seeing too much into this! Just... let it go, all right? It's all behind us now--let us look to the future rather than dissecting the past.~
@5465 = ~(sigh) You're referring to all this Prophecy nonsense, aren't you? I know a lot of people seem to think I'm the Child of Alaundo's Prophecy, but they also think that about every other powerful Bhaalspawn! It could refer to *any* of us in the long run. How do we know if the Wraith wouldn't do the exact same thing to Yaga Shura if he came here?~
@5466 = ~I must admit, I'd never considered it from that angle before. I suppose you do have a point. Yes, I do wonder and worry about how Gorion would have reacted to how I have turned out, but the Wraith implied many other things... other things that I can honestly say I have *never* considered. All in all, I think we should err on the side of scepticism. Constant scrutiny and analysing is bound to make you feel a little worried, and dare I add, paranoid.~
@5467 = ~And it is that which worries me the most, <CHARNAME>, that you do not have a say in what is going on. I am not much of a philosopher, as you know, but this lack of choice can't be a good thing.~
@5468 = ~I know this sounds horribly selfish, but what happens if you are made to make a choice between what we have and fulfilling your supposed destiny? Will you even have a choice, I wonder...~
@5469 = ~Fade, please, don't say things like that! It won't ever come to that, I won't let it. What ever happens, you will be involved--that I promise. I'm certainly not going to give you up because of this Prophecy!~
@5470 = ~I don't think you're being selfish, although I do think you're worrying needlessly. What will be, will be--just as it has always been, for everyone. It just happens that my fate is possibly a little more public than your average farmer or merchant.~
@5471 = ~So you have been losing sleep over too. Why didn't you tell me? I've been wondering how to approach you about all of this since the battle.~
@5472 = ~Yes, I am referring to this Prophecy of yours. I never once in the past stopped to think about your part in all of it, and it has only just recently just struck me how huge all this is.~
@5473 = ~I... I'm afraid, <CHARNAME>, afraid that all of this is going to end up tearing us apart. I know this sounds horribly selfish, but what happens if you are made to make a choice between what we have and fulfilling your supposed destiny? Will you even have a choice, I wonder...~
@5474 = ~No! I'm not saying that at all! In fact, I guess I'm saying the exact opposite... I'm worried that the Prophecy will take you from me, rather than the other way around.~
@5475 = ~My main concern is that what the Wraith said had to have come from somewhere! It's okay for you to say that you realise Gorion would never speak to you in such a way... but those fears must have been lurking inside you for the Wraith to have used them against you in the first place. And that is probably even more worrying than if it had actually been Gorion criticising you!~
@5476 = ~I know a lot of people seem to think I'm the Child of Alaundo's Prophecy, but they also think that about every other powerful Bhaalspawn! It could refer to *any* of us in the long run. How do we know if the Wraith wouldn't do the exact same thing to Yaga Shura if he came here?~
@5477 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... that is not what I meant at all. I know you would never intentionally hurt me, and I realise that the whole Slayer business was not your fault.~
@5478 = ~I am actually referring to the Prophecy that the Wraith disguised as Gorion alluded to. I never once in the past stopped to think about your part in all of it, and it has only just recently just struck me how huge all this is. I... I'm afraid, <CHARNAME>, afraid that all of this is going to end up tearing us apart...~
@5479 = ~Fade, that is simply not going to happen! I really, really think you need to calm down and think about this rationally--now I *know* you are seeing too much into this! Just... let it go, all right? It's all behind us now--let us look to the future rather than dissecting the past.~
@5480 = ~How can you say that?! Don't you realise? Don't you find it at all odd that the Wraith knew *exactly* what to say to get to you?~
@5481 = ~It's okay for you to say that you realise Gorion would never speak to you in such a way... but those fears must have been lurking inside you for the Wraith to have used them against you in the first place. And that is probably even more worrying than if it had actually been Gorion criticising you!~
@5482 = ~I... I feel the same way as you do, otherwise I would never have brought this up in the first place... but I do get ever so worried about you. You have so much to shoulder--I know I could never do it, even if I did have others there to support me along the way.~
@5483 = ~I don't want to burden you with extraneous fears and ramblings, but... if I don't tell you, I feel as if I'm about to burst! I'm just so frightened that I'm going to lose you over all of this, through no fault of your own.~
@5484 = ~(She leans into you and rests her head upon your shoulder.) <CHARNAME>... I hope you are right and all of this means nothing; that I am indeed looking too much into things. Maybe I should just concentrate on what we have now and stop second-guessing the future all the time, huh?~
@5485 = ~I think those are wise words indeed. I know I often say we should look to the future, but looking too far can be just as damaging as living in the past. Let's just celebrate in what we have together now.~
@5486 = ~(wrap your arms around her and say nothing, just hold her tightly to you)~
@5487 = ~(sigh) Fade, you mean everything to me, but I simply don't have all the answers. All I can suggest is that we take one day at a time. If we carry on the way we are going, I can't see there being any problem, can you?~
@5488 = ~(As if momentarily lost for words, Fade just stares at you. She then near lunges at you and envelopes you in a fierce embrace.)~
@5489 = ~That is all I wanted to hear! That no matter what is going on around us, we will stay strong... and that you think what we have is worth fighting for.~
@5490 = ~No! <CHARNAME>... it is because my feelings for you are so strong that I get so worried! As I have said before, I have *never* felt this way about someone before, not even Keita. You are the single most important thing in my life, and I don't want *anything* to jeopardise it.~
@5491 = ~Enemies and monsters I can cope with; I can fight them off! Prophecies, however... now that's a different kettle of fish altogether.~
@5492 = ~But the future is so uncertain, and to in order to cope with it, we have to learn from the past! (sigh) I do not mean to be awkward, <CHARNAME>... it is simply because my feelings for you are so strong that I get so worried!~
@5493 = ~As I have said before, I have *never* felt this way about someone before... not even Keita. You are the single most important thing in my life, and I don't want *anything* to jeopardise it.~
@5494 = ~I... I never considered that. So maybe the Wraith is simply a test--a test designed by... whoever is controlling all this prophecy malarkey, to test your suitability, maybe? But suitability for *what*? I cannot help but think it isn't going to be anything good.~
@5495 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I don't want to burden you with extraneous fears and ramblings, but... if I don't tell you, I feel as if I'm about to burst! I'm just so frightened that I'm going to lose you over all of this, through no fault of your own.~
@5496 = ~(Fade offers you a rather self-depreciating grin.) Okay... good point. All my thoughts seem to end up doing is chasing each other in my mind.~
@5497 = ~I don't mean nor want to burden you with extraneous fears and ramblings, but... if I don't tell you, I feel as if I'm about to burst! I'm just so frightened that I'm going to lose you over all of this, through no fault of your own.~
@5498 = ~It is because my feelings for you are so strong that I get so worried, and I am sorry. As I have said before, I have *never* felt this way about someone before... not even Keita. You are the single most important thing in my life, and I don't want *anything* to jeopardise it.~
@5499 = ~I hope you are right, I really do. It is only because my feelings for you are so strong that I do get so worried. As I have said before, I have *never* felt this way about someone before... not even Keita. You are the single most important thing in my life, and I don't want *anything* to jeopardise it.~
@5500 = ~(Fade looks up, nods and then places a kiss on your cheek.) As always, you are right, my love. What we have is special, and needless worrying should now be allowed to jeopardise that.~
@5501 = ~(With a decidedly impish grin, Fade's formerly grave countenance changes to a more familiar one of mischief.) So... fancy celebrating later?~
@5502 = ~Wicked woman! (grin) I thought you'd never ask.~
@5503 = ~(wink) Later? Why later? How about now?~
@5504 = ~(She holds on to you for a long time. With a sigh she eventually pushes away slightly so she can look at you.) I hope that means you agree with me? I just think that what we have is special... and I don't want anything to ruin it for us, including Gods and prophecies.~
@5505 = ~(grin) Call me selfish if you will, but I want you all to myself!~
@5506 = ~I suppose not. I do not mean to be awkward, <CHARNAME>... it is simply because my feelings for you are so strong that I get so worried! As I have said before, I have *never* felt this way about someone before... not even Keita. You are the single most important thing in my life, and I don't want *anything* to jeopardise it.~
@5507 = ~Wicked woman? Well... I do have a reputation to maintain... one that perhaps I should be re-affirming with you later? (wink)~
@5508 = ~Now?! Ooh, <CHARNAME>, you thoroughly naughty <RACE>! Anywhere near here secluded enough for you? If so... (wink)~
@5509 = ~An entire city... wiped out. All I can see in my mind's eye are the burnt out buildings, and all I can recall is the stench of death. All those people...~
@5510 = ~I know. I wish there was something I could have done to prevent it all. I kind of feel that I have... failed them in some way.~
@5511 = ~Me too. But I'm determined not to let this one incident get me down, nor prevent me from dealing with the others.~
@5512 = ~(sigh) Yes. One moment leading normal, ordinary lives; the next plunged into a war they never asked for. Such is life, however. Best not to dwell on it.~
@5513 = ~What are you going on about now, Fade? Are you going soft on me? Why should you care what happened to the people of Saradush?~
@5514 = ~You shouldn't blame yourself, <CHARNAME>. You did all you could to help those poor people.~
@5515 = ~(She looks away from you and stares into the distance for a while, chewing on her nails. All of a sudden, she looks back at you with a worried frown.)~
@5516 = ~For a moment I thought you might have revelled in it. You know, Bhaal's blood telling and all that...~
@5517 = ~WHAT?! What in the Realms makes you say that? I would *never* revel in such misery--I thought you knew me better than that!~
@5518 = ~What, like you did? I saw the light in your eyes. Each time we fight, each time we are embroiled in any kind of chaotic carnage... I know you try to deny it, but it's there.~
@5519 = ~Revelled in it? No. To be honest, I am kind of numb to it all now. Death and killing used to horrify me--now it just seems another inevitable part of my life.~
@5520 = ~What are you saying? Did you... notice anything different about me back there? Is that what you're trying to tell me?~
@5521 = ~Forever the optimist, eh? Still, didn't you feel anything? Any spark of... exhilaration at defeating one as powerful as Yaga Shura? His defeat truly was quite an impressive spectacle, considering he was deemed invincible.~
@5522 = ~Maybe so, but I wish it could have been done without all the unnecessary bloodshed. I wonder how many more Saradushes there will be before all this is over.~
@5523 = ~The battle was indeed an exhilarating experience, I will admit that. It is a shame such things come at such a high price, though.~
@5524 = ~Of course I felt something! Knowing that I alone defeated what was supposed to be invulnerable... invincible. I know others may find this a little unsavoury, but by the Gods, it makes you feel damn good to be alive!~
@5525 = ~Do I detect a little bit of self-satisfaction there, Fade? I thought you never wanted to stoke your own bloodlust again.~
@5526 = ~"Such is life"? Well, maybe for you, but not necessarily for those poor people. If it wasn't for you and your kin, Saradush would still be standing!~
@5527 = ~Now that's totally unfair! I never asked for any of that to happen. I do regret what has happened, of course I do, but I can't agonise over every single little thing that goes on around me!~
@5528 = ~Why in the Realms would you say something like that to me? Are you trying to pick a fight, Fade?~
@5529 = ~Hmmm... I think someone is trying to justify her own unsavoury bloodlust and transfer a little of the guilt she feels for it onto someone else... am I right?~
@5530 = ~Soft?! What do you mean? Is learning to feel some level of compassion for others going "soft"?~
@5531 = ~Ahhh, Fade... you try to deny it, but I saw you, fighting along side me with the widest of grins. We make a good team, you and I.~
@5532 = ~Of course I do... and I'm sorry. I... I had just hoped I wasn't the only one who felt some measure of, well, satisfaction in all the carnage.~
@5533 = ~Okay, I'll level with you--I did feel something. Knowing that I alone defeated what was supposed to be invulnerable... invincible... I know others may find this a little unsavoury, but by the Gods, it makes you feel damn good to be alive!~
@5534 = ~You... you felt *satisfied*? Fade, I thought you'd abandoned that side of your heritage?~
@5535 = ~I was happy to see Yaga Shura fall, although I know that is not what you're referring to. I saw the light in your eyes--it's there each time we fight, each time we are embroiled in any kind of chaotic carnage. I know you try to deny it, but it's there.~
@5536 = ~(Fade looks away from you, anger and shame battling their way obviously over her features.) I wish it would go away, <CHARNAME>... all the exultant feelings of fulfilment and gratification that bloodshed can only bring. Afterwards I am so disgusted with myself, but at the time, it feels so *right*!~
@5537 = ~You're being too hard on yourself, Fade. Okay, I'll level with you--I did feel something. Knowing that I alone defeated what was supposed to be invulnerable... invincible... I know others may find this a little unsavoury, but by the Gods, it makes you feel damn good to be alive!~
@5538 = ~Of course surviving such brutality is exhilarating. It's only natural to feel this way when the odds are stacked against you and yet you prevail! It's not like you are randomly murdering passers-by.~
@5539 = ~I know. There are times when I find myself feeling so... so fulfilled when I see the light leave my enemy's eyes. It can be frightening.~
@5540 = ~I... I don't know what's worse, <CHARNAME>--feeling exhilarated, or feeling nothing. Sometimes... sometimes I do wonder if we will ever be able to lead normal lives, even once all of this is over. What happens if we become so numbed to it that life itself loses its appeal?~
@5541 = ~That will never happen, Fade. Whilst we may grow weary of death and bloodshed, life has an infinite fascination for me.~
@5542 = ~Neither of us was ever cut out for a normal life, my love. Once this is all over, we'll just have to do our best.~
@5543 = ~Of course we will be able to lead normal lives! We're in an extraordinary situation right now--we're all bound to react differently. I'm positive that if you spoke to the others, you'd discover that they're all feeling the same way you and I are. It's only natural.~
@5544 = ~(sigh) No, not about you, <CHARNAME>. I... I had just hoped I wasn't the only one who felt some measure of, well, satisfaction in all the carnage.~
@5545 = ~None, I hope. I don't think I can stand feeling like this anymore.~
@5546 = ~What do you mean? Do you grow weary of battle? Of fighting by my side?~
@5547 = ~I know what you mean. I saw the light in your eyes--it's there each time we fight, each time we are embroiled in any kind of chaotic carnage. I know you try to deny it, but it's there.~
@5548 = ~Yes... all those people.~
@5549 = ~And what if I did?~
@5550 = ~Yes... it does, doesn't it? You're right--it's only natural to feel good after defeating such a strong enemy. Yes. Natural...~
@5551 = ~You don't sound so convinced, Fade.~
@5552 = ~My love, I know you're worried you'll end up the way you used to be, but your temper has improved in leaps and bounds since I first met you! Once upon a time you'd snap at anything; now you will listen and reason. There is nothing--I repeat--*nothing* wrong with you. Okay?~
@5553 = ~Yep, natural. And your dismay at what happened at Saradush is also natural, but now it is time to move on. We've got much to do.~
@5554 = ~I... I don't. But sometimes it's so hard... when all you can hear is the screams of the injured and all you can smell is fresh, warm blood, everything around you is saturated in pure chaos...~
@5555 = ~I feel the pull, <CHARNAME>, be it here in this gods-forsaken city or in that damnable pocketplane. Sometimes I feel as if the whole of the Realms is just out there to tempt me back to my old ways. I try to deny it, but it follows me around, like some kind of corrupted shadow.~
@5556 = ~Every *little* thing? I don't call an entire city something *little*! Oh, but that's right. Big important Bhaalspawn simply don't have the time to worry over the lives they've ruined in their pursuit of power, do they?!~
@5557 = ~I'd be very, very careful in what you say next, Fey'ri!~
@5558 = ~(Fade glares at you and you see the corners of her mouth begin to twist into an ugly snarl. Suddenly she turns away from you, breathing heavily.)~
@5559 = ~<CHARNAME>, I... it's so hard... when all you can hear is the screams of the injured and all you can smell is fresh, warm blood, everything around you is saturated in pure chaos...~
@5560 = ~Back there, during the battle, I didn't think about the consequences of our fight--in fact, I could hardly think at all! I am ashamed to admit that... that I just wanted to *revel* in such carnage. I felt exhilarated!~
@5561 = ~You needn't feel ashamed, Fade. I know how you feel. There are times when I find myself feeling so... so *fulfilled* when I see the light leave my enemy's eyes. It can be frightening.~
@5562 = ~That was not my point, <CHARNAME>. I for one am ashamed of my exhilaration and bloodlust during that battle. I... I  thought I was more capable of controlling myself, but I just seem to have proven myself wrong yet again.~
@5563 = ~Please... leave me be for a while. I need to think about this on my own terms.~
@5564 = ~I have! As much as it is possible, that is. Sometimes it's so hard... when all you can hear is the screams of the injured and all you can smell is fresh, warm blood, everything around you is saturated in pure chaos...~
@5565 = ~Yet, <CHARNAME>. I'm not attacking random passers-by *yet*. For now my cravings are just reserved for the battle field--but what if things get out of hand?~
@5566 = ~Sometimes it's so hard... when all you can hear is the screams of the injured and all you can smell is fresh, warm blood, everything around you is saturated in pure chaos...~
@5567 = ~There are times when I wonder if our alliance is such a good thing. However, the fact that we can talk rationally about our reactions to such things means we are not so far down the path to total self-destruction.~
@5568 = ~In a way, I am glad to hear that such a response in yourself frightens you--it means you still care, even after all you've been through.~
@5569 = ~Your lust for life cheers me, <CHARNAME>. I wish I could share in your optimism right now. I hope that once this battle is nothing more than an unpleasant memory I shall be able to look back on it in a more objective way.~
@5570 = ~That is probably the most... practical answer I could have hoped for, I suppose. (sigh) And you're right--even after all of this is over, I doubt we'll be able to settle down to a completely non-descript life. You've definitely drawn a very large hand form the cards of Fate, <CHARNAME>.~
@5571 = ~Really? You think the others feel as we do? And here I was, selfishly thinking I was the only one who gets caught up in bloodlust. That is... oddly comforting <CHARNAME>.~
@5572 = ~No, that's not what I meant. I don't grow weary of fighting by your side at all. It's just that sometimes it's so hard... when all you can hear is the screams of the injured and all you can smell is fresh, warm blood, everything around you is saturated in pure chaos...~
@5573 = ~You *did*? You freely admit that the slaughter of hundreds of people is something to be revelled in? Something to *enjoy*?!~
@5574 = ~What's wrong, Fade? You try to deny it, but I saw you--fighting alongside me with the widest of grins. We make a good team, you and I.~
@5575 = ~Okay, I think someone is trying to justify her own unsavoury bloodlust and transfer a little of the guilt she feels for it onto someone else... am I right?~
@5576 = ~Err, what point are you trying to make here, Fade? Are you trying to pick a fight or something?~
@5577 = ~(sigh) I'm not sure I am. Sometimes I think I can cope, that I can truly leave my heritage behind... but then something like this happens and I realise that is not the case.~
@5578 = ~I hope you are right. Your lust for life cheers me, <CHARNAME>. I wish I could share in your optimism right now. I hope that once this battle is nothing more than an unpleasant memory I shall be able to look back on it in a more objective way.~
@5579 = ~Time to move on? I suppose that is one way to deal with your feelings--ignore their existence.~
@5580 = ~I for one am ashamed of my exhilaration and bloodlust during that battle. I... I  thought I was more capable of controlling myself, but I just seem to have proven myself wrong yet again. I turned to you for help, but it seems you have more important things to be dealing with.~
@5581 = ~Or what? (Fade glares at you and you see the corners of her mouth begin to twist into an ugly snarl. Suddenly she turns away from you, breathing heavily.)~
@5582 = ~<CHARNAME>... no... I... I  didn't mean that. It's so hard... when all you can hear is the screams of the injured and all you can smell is fresh, warm blood, everything around you is saturated in pure chaos...~
@5583 = ~We draw near the end, <CHARNAME>... the end of all of this. On one hand it will be a relief that it is finally all over. On the other hand...~
@5584 = ~"On the other hand"... what?~
@5585 = ~I know what you mean, Fade. This truly is it--the big one. After this, who knows what will happen?~
@5586 = ~Oh, my love, don't look so worried! We will come out of this fine, you'll see!~
@5587 = ~Are you sure you want to do this, Fade? I have a feeling this is going to be... difficult, and I do not want to endanger you or our child.~
@5588 = ~You don't have to do this if you don't want to, Fade. I won't blame you if you just wanted to walk away from it all. It's neither your fight nor your prophecy, after all.~
@5589 = ~(sigh) On the other hand, we have no idea how this will end. I have dreamt of a happy ending for us both, but this prophecy... it indicates that there is so much more you could do; so much more you could become.~
@5590 = ~I am scared, <CHARNAME>, scared out of my wits, not because of what we may face in this final battle, but because of the choices we maybe forced into making.~
@5591 = ~Choices? Fade, if I thought I had a choice about all this I might be thinking twice, but there isn't one! I have to do this--it is my destiny. I thought you realised that.~
@5592 = ~Once this is over, we can then dedicate our lives to each other--nothing more, nothing less. That is what you want to happen, isn't it?~
@5593 = ~Please, don't be scared--there is no need for it! Whatever we have to face in there we will face it together... and come out of it together. I promise!~
@5594 = ~I've already made my choices, my love. I have you and our baby--what more could I want? Whatever else I am offered, I will always choose the two of you.~
@5595 = ~Is this to do with the Slayer? That in order for the prophecy to be fulfilled, the Slayer will have to be defeated? Is that what you fear?~
@5596 = ~Exactly. Anything could happen from here on in... anything at all. Have you given any thought to it? Any thoughts at all?~
@5597 = ~Of course I have--it is all I have been thinking about. But one thing I do know is that whatever does transpire, whatever we have to face in there, we will indeed face it together, as we have faced many trials and battles before... and, as before, we shall overcome! Of this, I am sure.~
@5598 = ~I have thought of nothing else, Fade. I know we will be victorious, and once this is over, we can then dedicate our lives to each other--nothing more, nothing less. That is what you want to happen, isn't it?~
@5599 = ~Not really. I have just been taking one thing at a time. I have found that it is futile to try to second-guess the future... I had hoped you would have realised this by now too. What will be, will be, and there is nothing any of us can do about that.~
@5600 = ~So you say, but we have no idea how this will end. I have dreamt of a happy ending for us both, but this prophecy... it indicates that there is so much more you could do; so much more you could become.~
@5601 = ~(smile) Wherever you go, I go too... and therefore so does our child. We are a family now. I could not stand on the sidelines and watch you fight before, and I am certainly not going to do it now.~
@5602 = ~This battle is going to be hard--probably the hardest we have ever faced--but we will face it together.~
@5603 = ~Well, if you are sure. I know better than to argue with you about these things. Just... please take heed of all I have said in the past. As you said yourself, we are a family now, and without you and the baby, I have no family left.~
@5604 = ~Although I know I will be watching your every step, I am... glad you want to fight by my side. I had to make the offer, though. I would not blame you at all for wanting to stay safe.~
@5605 = ~We will indeed face it together, as we have faced many trials and battles before... and, as before, we shall overcome! Of this, I am sure.~
@5606 = ~(smile) Wherever you go, I go too. You know that. I could not stand on the sidelines and watch you fight before, and I am certainly not going to do it now.~
@5607 = ~It makes me... glad to hear you say that, Fade. You do understand that I had to make the offer, don't you? I would not blame you at all for wanting to stay safe. This is indeed going to be dangerous.~
@5608 = ~Of course I realise! That is why I am not begging you to stop--I know you have to do this. But that doesn't make it any easier to cope with.~
@5609 = ~<CHARNAME>... I just want you to know that if... if we don't come out of this together, you are simply the most amazing man I have ever met... that I love you and I always will, no matter what happens. No one will ever bring me as much joy as you have... no one else will ever be in my heart.~
@5610 = ~Whoa, Fade! What are you saying? You don't think I'm going to survive this fight?~
@5611 = ~You know I feel the same way my love, but please, do not think like this. We will both come out of this fine.~
@5612 = ~Darling... please do not say such things. It is like you're saying "goodbye" to me.~
@5613 = ~Of course that is what I want to happen! I wouldn't have accepted your proposal if that wasn't the case. In all honesty, I cannot wait for a time when we can be a... well, not a "normal" couple, I doubt we shall ever be that... but as "normal" a couple as we can be.~
@5614 = ~(grin) A nice cottage somewhere, just the two of us for a while... how does that sound to you?~
@5615 = ~That sounds perfect to me! A place away from any prying eyes, where we can just be together... sounds likes heaven.~
@5616 = ~A nice cottage?! I was hoping for something a little grander than that. A nice castle, perhaps!~
@5617 = ~(grin) No, we've never been "normal", have we? Most men only dream about having their own personal little succubus...~
@5618 = ~Dedicate? That's a very... strong word to use, <CHARNAME>. People only use that word when they are thinking of marriage and the like...~
@5619 = ~Well... I suppose that is what I am thinking of. I was going to wait until after all this is over, but since it has now come up... oh, to the Hells with it! Would you consider marrying me?~
@5620 = ~Are you saying you don't want us to be dedicated to each other?~
@5621 = ~(smile) I think we should get all of this over and done with first, don't you? We shall have plenty of time to discuss things of that nature later.~
@5622 = ~I hope you are right --I really, really do. But just in case that isn't the case, I just want you to know that... that you are the most amazing man I have ever met; that I love you and I always will, no matter what. No one will ever bring me as much joy as you have... no one else will ever be in my heart.~
@5623 = ~It does my heart good to hear you say that, <CHARNAME>. I just hope you are allowed to make that choice. I do not know what I would do without you. I... I need you here with me; I simply do not think I can live my life and raise this child alone.~
@5624 = ~I just want you to know that you are simply the most amazing man I have ever met... and that I love you and I always will, no matter what happens. No one will ever bring me as much joy as you have... no one else will ever be in my heart.~
@5625 = ~You won't have to raise this child alone, my love. I will be there. Everything will be as we have dreamed it would be, Fade. I won't allow it to be any other way.~
@5626 = ~Maybe, since the Slayer is the Avatar of Bhaal, and all of this seems to be a fight for his Throne.~
@5627 = ~<CHARNAME>, what if that's what this is all about? That it is inevitable... that you cannot walk away from all of this... that I will lose you no matter who wins.~
@5628 = ~If that is the case, I just want you to know that... that you are the most amazing man I have ever met; that I love you and I always will, no matter what. No one will ever bring me as much joy as you have... no one else will ever be in my heart.~
@5629 = ~I sincerely hope you are right, but we have no idea how this will end. I have dreamt of a happy ending for us both, but this prophecy... it indicates that there is so much more you could do; so much more you could become.~
@5630 = ~You are a pragmatic man, though as true though those words may be, they are hardly comforting. If only we could but glimpse the future this once... (sigh)~
@5631 = ~<CHARNAME>, just in case things do take a turn for the worst, I... I want you to know that you are the most amazing man I have ever met; that I love you and I always will, no matter what. No one will ever bring me as much joy as you have... no one else will ever be in my heart.~
@5632 = ~(smile) I am most pleased to hear you say you consider us a family, <CHARNAME>, and of course I will take heed of all your lectures about keeping myself safe! I just want you to know that you are simply the most amazing man I have ever met... and that I love you and I always will, no matter what happens. No one will ever bring me as much joy as you have... no one else will ever be in my heart.~
@5633 = ~But saying that... please be careful. I do not know what I would do without you. I... I need you here with me; I simply do not think I can live my life and raise this child alone.~
@5634 = ~Have I not proved to you that I am capable of looking after myself yet, <CHARNAME>? You do not have to watch me--I would not want you to make a mistake because of it! I could never forgive myself if something happened because you were worrying about me and not yourself...~
@5635 = ~Fade, are you ever going to realise when I am teasing you and when I am not? Although I do worry about you in battle, it is only natural considering how much I love you. I know you are more than capable of looking after yourself!~
@5636 = ~I cannot help it, Fade. You are everything I hold dear. Oh, how I wish this was all over now...~
@5637 = ~Fade, without you, there would be no reason for me to worry about myself. So, in effect, my worrying about you gives me reason to make sure I stay safe... (grin) I think that makes sense!~
@5638 = ~Of course I understand why you made the offer, and of course I realise it's going to be dangerous--you seem to attract danger as a honey pot attracts bees! However, I think the danger is a little more than just an enraged enemy this time... this time we have your prophecy to contend with as well.~
@5639 = ~It indicates that there is so much more you could do; so much more you could become, and that is what scares me, <CHARNAME>. It isn't what we may face in this final battle, but the choices we maybe forced into making whilst fighting it.~
@5640 = ~Of course not!  I am just being a little paranoid and maudlin again. I... just wanted you to know these things, just in case. The worst thing about losing Keita was never having that one last time to tell her how I felt, and I am not going to waste that opportunity now. We can laugh at my... silliness once this is all over, but for now, please... take my words to heart.~
@5641 = ~Now let us go and meet your destiny.~
@5642 = ~I sincerely hope so too... and please do not take this as any kind of aspersion upon your ability to defeat what ever is waiting for us! Maybe I am being just a little bit more paranoid than usual, but the worst thing about losing Keita was never having that one last time to tell her how I felt... and I am not going to waste that opportunity now. We can laugh at my... silliness once this is all over, but for now, please... take my words to heart.~
@5643 = ~Now let us go forth and meet your destiny.~
@5644 = ~Maybe I am, for I doubt either of us will be the same once this battle is over. We have both changed so profoundly since we first met one another... I often wonder how we will ever cope without the constant threats we have had to endure.~
@5645 = ~But listen to me... I am being even more paranoid than usual. I just wanted you to be in no doubt as to how I feel about you, <CHARNAME>, no matter what happens in there.~
@5646 = ~Yes, it does, doesn't it? Almost too good to be true, even.~
@5647 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I wish we had a crystal ball! One where we could look to the future and know if all of this is going to turn out all right. I simply cannot bear to think that after all we have been through, we may be wrenched apart after all!~
@5648 = ~Please, do not say such things! Whatever we have to face in there, we will face it together... and come out of it together, I promise!~
@5649 = ~I wish we had the same thing, Fade, but we don't. We will simply have to see what happens. There is no point in trying to second-guess the future--I had hoped you would have realised this by now too. What will be, will be, and there is nothing any of us can do about that.~
@5650 = ~A... a *castle*?~
@5651 = ~(laugh) I suppose one of your station does deserve one, although, and believe me, I never thought I would hear myself say this, I think I would prefer something smaller and more... intimate for the both of us. Somewhere with no prying eyes... somewhere we can truly be alone together, just you and I.~
@5652 = ~Wow, that's definitely something I never thought I'd hear you say either, Fade! What about the hustle and bustle of the city? I thought you thrived on that?~
@5653 = ~Actually, putting it like that, that does sound like a little piece of heaven.~
@5654 = ~Then that is what we shall have, my love--your wish is my command!~
@5655 = ~(Fade quirks a crimson eyebrow and grins back at you.) And I suspect most women only dream about having their own little demi-god to fulfil their every whim and desire! Oh, I hope this all works out okay, <CHARNAME>... I cannot bear to think of life without your ability to see on the lighter side of everything.~
@5656 = ~Just in case things do not go the way we want them to, I just want to make sure that you know that you are the most amazing man I have ever met... that I love you and I always will, no matter what. No one will ever bring me as much joy as you have... no one else will ever be in my heart.~
@5657 = ~M-marry you? <CHARNAME>... this is most unexpected! And hardly the most appropriate place to propose such a thing...~
@5658 = ~(She takes a deep breath.) But... but... yes. Once this is all over, I will marry you gladly. In all honesty, I... I had hoped you would ask me at some point.~
@5659 = ~You agree? You will marry me? Then I am indeed the happiest man on all Faerun. Nothing can happen now to jeopardise this battle, for I will most definitely be fighting it in your name!~
@5660 = ~Did you ever doubt that I would? I wanted it to be special, however--not just before a huge battle! But no matter; you have made me the happiest man in Faerun.~
@5661 = ~You did? I never plucked up the courage to ask before because I thought you would be disdainful of marriage! You live and learn, I suppose.~
@5662 = ~No! Of course I am not saying that! I hope we can dedicate our lives to each other once all of this is over.~
@5663 = ~I just wish we had a crystal ball, just this one time! One where we could look to the future and know if all of this is going to turn out all right. I simply cannot bear to think that after all we have been through, we may be wrenched apart after all!~
@5664 = ~Yes, of course, you are right. I was getting a little carried away, there... sorry. We should be concentrating on the imminent battle, not dwelling on silly flights of fancy.~
@5665 = ~That's not what I meant, Fade. Once this battle is over, I hope that we can be married--I just didn't think that it was at all appropriate now to ask. I want to do it properly, my love. You deserve nothing less.~
@5666 = ~Honeykitten, I am not saying such things are mere flights of fancy, but they are not really appropriate now. We do not know what is going to happen after or even during this battle, and we both know that second-guessing the future is futile. What will be, will be, and there is nothing any of us can do about that.~
@5667 = ~I... I sincerely hope you are right, <CHARNAME>... and please do not take this as any kind of aspersion upon your ability to defend your child and defeat what ever is waiting for us!~
@5668 = ~Maybe I am being just a little bit more paranoid than usual, but the worst thing about losing Keita was never having that one last time to tell her how I felt... and I am not going to waste that opportunity now. We can laugh at my... silliness once this is all over, but for now, please... take my words to heart.~
@5669 = ~(smile) Even when facing your destiny, you retain your sense of humour.  How many jokes have we shared? How many times have we laughed together? I cannot stand to think that this could be the last time!~
@5670 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I wish we had a crystal ball, one where we could look to the future and know if all of this is going to turn out all right. I simply cannot bear to think that after all we have been through, we may be wrenched apart after all!~
@5671 = ~Please, do not say such things! Whatever we have to face in there we will face it together... and come out of it together. I promise!~
@5672 = ~Whoa, Fade! What are you saying? You don't think I'm going to survive this fight?~
@5673 = ~I wish we had the same thing, Fade, but we don't. We will simply have to see what happens. There is no point in trying to second-guess the future--I had hoped you would have realised this by now too. What will be, will be... and there is nothing any of us can do about that.~
@5674 = ~I know... I know. I feel the same way, I suppose.~
@5675 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I wish we had a crystal ball--one where we could look at the future and know if all of this is going to turn out all right. I simply cannot bear to think that after all we have been through, we may be wrenched apart after all!~
@5676 = ~I suppose it does... kind of. I do take your point. Please don't take this as any kind of aspersion upon your ability to defeat what ever is waiting for us! Maybe I am being just a little bit more paranoid than usual, but the worst thing about losing Keita was never having that one last time to tell her how I felt... and I am not going to waste that opportunity now.~
@5677 = ~We can laugh at my... silliness once this is all over, but for now, please... take my words to heart. Now let us go forth and meet your destiny.~
@5678 = ~So did I, but I have realised I already have the greatest treasure a woman could ever want--you. All the gold and glittering baubles in the world are so much rubbish compared to your heart.~
@5679 = ~(sigh) I wish it was, <CHARNAME>... for then I could wish that this battle would be over and done with and we would already know the outcome.~
@5680 = ~Oh, I just wish we had a crystal ball, just this one time! One where we could look to the future and know if all of this is going to turn out all right. I simply cannot bear to think that after all we have been through, we may be wrenched apart after all!~
@5681 = ~(smile) And I will be fighting for you, and for what we have, <CHARNAME>... you can count on that.~
@5682 = ~No matter what happens, I will never forget you or the promise you have made to me... that we have now made to each other. I love you, and I always will. No one will ever bring me as much joy as you have... no one else will ever be in my heart.~
@5683 = ~(grin) If you were waiting for that perfect moment, I doubt you would ever find it, <CHARNAME>--it seems our lives are always going to be "eventful", to say the least! I can now go into battle with a much lighter heart. No matter what happens, I will never forget you or the promise you have made to me... that we have now made to each other.~
@5684 = ~Now let us delay no longer--let us meet your destiny!~
@5685 = ~Once upon a time, I was disdainful of love in general, <CHARNAME>, but you have taught me differently.~
@5686 = ~<CHARNAME>... I do not deserve anything. You have already brought me more joy than I could ever imagine. No matter what happens I will never forget you--I love you and I always will. No one else will ever replace you in my heart.~
@5687 = ~So here we are, on the road again.~
@5688 = ~So it seems. Can't be helped, I suppose.~
@5689 = ~Okay, I can tell by that little look and the tone of your voice you're not entirely happy with the situation. What's wrong?~
@5690 = ~Indeed we are. And we have much to do. I had hoped there would have been a chance for us to rest, but alas, it seems it is not to be.~
@5691 = ~Great, isn't it? I mean, I liked having a bit of a rest, but it did get rather boring after a while.~
@5692 = ~I suppose not. And I suppose we'll be forced yet again, no doubt, to fight for the rights of others when we could be spending some time alone together. Great.~
@5693 = ~What's wrong? At least we are together, which is more than some people ever have.~
@5694 = ~Oh, come on! What could be better? Are you telling me you would have been happy staying in Suldanessellar, with no adventure to look forward to?~
@5695 = ~I do know how you feel, Fade, and I suppose I'm sorry. It seems as if I'm destined never to have any time for myself... for us.~
@5696 = ~Please, don't be like that. Such is my life, dearest. (tentative smile) You should have realised this would have been the case--maybe you should have thought harder before throwing in your lot with me?~
@5697 = ~Nothing is wrong... not really. I just hoped that after the last adventure, we would have had at least some time on our own. It would have been nice if it had just been the two of us together for a while before we got dragged off again.~
@5698 = ~I do know how you feel, but such is my life, dearest. (tentative smile) You should have realised this would have been the case--maybe you should have thought harder before throwing in your lot with me?~
@5699 = ~This is the life I choose, Fade, and I would hope it's your choice as well. I don't want to force you into travelling, although if this is the way you feel about it, I fear it will always be an obstacle we will have to face.~
@5700 = ~I know we didn't have much time, and I would have much rather it had been longer, but at least we are still together. (malicious grin) I could have left you there, as my sweet, delicate Lady, awaiting the return of her heroic sweetheart...~
@5701 = ~I had hoped the same. However, we seem to have yet again been forced into fighting for the rights of others when we could be spending some time alone together. Great.~
@5702 = ~My darling, it's not as if we have much of a choice! What's wrong? At least we are together, which is more than some people ever have.~
@5703 = ~So, you found the time we spent together in Suldanessellar boring? You'd rather be on the road than relaxing in my arms? I see.~
@5704 = ~What? No! That's not at all what I meant! You know I want nothing more than to be in you arms, but you also know I'm just not the type to sit still and do nothing. Be reasonable!~
@5705 = ~(sigh) Fade, stop being difficult. No one made you come with me--you could have stayed in Suldanessellar. I wouldn't have thought any less of you, nor would I have loved you any less.~
@5706 = ~(grin) Are you complaining again? Bless my little honeykitten, only happy when she's got something to be annoyed about...~
@5707 = ~Oh... nothing is wrong, I suppose, and I know you're right. I was just hoping that we would, you know, have more time to ourselves now. I had hoped the adventure to be over--at least for a while!~
@5708 = ~(She looks at you in slight disbelief and then shakes her head.) You're serious, aren't you? You really do live for the adventuring life.~
@5709 = ~Well... of course I do. It's better than being forced into your father's footsteps, or into a life I'd rather not have. Would you rather I was a storekeep, or a blacksmith?~
@5710 = ~(Fade smiles rather wryly and takes your hand in hers.) I wasn't fishing for an apology, <CHARNAME>. I had just hoped the adventure to be over--at least for a while. I was looking forward to the two of us having a little bit of time to ourselves. I don't want to be awkward, or to moan. It's just... life isn't very fair, is it?~
@5711 = ~(smile) I'm looking forward to the time we can have more time for just us, I really am, but at the moment, it's just not possible. Again, I'm not left with much of a choice.~
@5712 = ~Not always... but this is the life I choose, Fade, and I would hope it's your choice as well. I don't want to force you into travelling, although if this is the way you feel about it, I fear it will always be an obstacle we will have to face.~
@5713 = ~No, it isn't. I know we didn't have much time on our own, and I would have much rather it had been longer, but at least we are still together. (malicious grin) I could have left you there, as my sweet, delicate Lady, awaiting the return of her heroic sweetheart...~
@5714 = ~(Despite herself, Fade smiles back at you.) Maybe I should have done. Although I don't think it would have made any kind of difference. I held back from you for as long as I could... I suppose I knew loving you wouldn't be easy. I just wish we could have had at least a short while to ourselves.~
@5715 = ~(sigh) No... no, I don't wish that at all. I'm glad you're happy with your lot in life. I had just hoped we could have spent a little more time together, just the two of us. We seem to be constantly swept from one battle to another, with little space to breathe, let alone to think.~
@5716 = ~Once I relished such a life; now... now... I just don't know anymore. You're always running around, dealing with everyone else's problems... but I don't want to share you, I don't want you to be there for everyone else. I want you all to myself!~
@5717 = ~(She leans into you, obviously wanting to be held.)~
@5718 = ~(take the hint and hold her close) I never realised you felt this way. I'm afraid that's the way it's going to be... people will always need my help, and I will always give it to them. But that shouldn't get in the way of the two of us. I just want to help others. I love you. And therein lies the difference.~
@5719 = ~(hold her close to you) I want exactly the same things as you do, my love. You will always come first. (smile) You always have, ever since I first met you, whether you realise it or not.~
@5720 = ~A sweet sentiment, but not very practical. Sometimes we all have to share, and we cannot hoard people and their affections as if they were gold. What we have is truly special, I know this, but I also have responsibilities elsewhere.~
@5721 = ~You don't have to force me travel with you, and yes, it is my choice. I just want to be able to spend a little bit of time with you minus the mud, bad food and frequent bloody battles. Is that so bad?~
@5722 = ~I want to be able to relax, to share an intimate moment without worrying who may be watching, to be able to spend time with you without looking over my shoulder for the ever-growing horde of enemies you seem to have attracted.~
@5723 = ~I'm sorry. I should be assisting you, but I just can't help how I feel. I don't want to share you; I don't want you to be there for everyone else. I want you all to myself!~
@5724 = ~Sweet? Delicate?! (She laughs and playfully cuffs your ear.) Now there are a couple of words I never thought would be applied to myself!~
@5725 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, I just want to be able to spend a little bit of time with you minus the mud, bad food and frequent bloody battles. Is that so bad?~
@5726 = ~(hold her close to you) I was teasing, of course... but you are the dearest thing to me in my life. There is no need for apologies--you know I feel the same way. You will always come first. (smile) You always have, ever since I first met you, whether you realise it or not.~
@5727 = ~(take the hint and hold her close) I'm afraid that's the way it's going to be... people will always need my help, and I will always give it to them. But that shouldn't get in the way of the two of us. I just want to help others. I love you. And therein lies the difference.~
@5728 = ~You have the cheek to tell me to be reasonable?! <CHARNAME>, I just want to be able to spend a little bit of time with you minus the mud, bad food and frequent bloody battles! Is that so bad?~
@5729 = ~I... I don't want to be awkward, or to moan. I just want you all to myself for once! I don't want to share you, I don't want you to be there for everyone else. I know I'm being selfish and that I should be assisting you, but I just can't help how I feel.~
@5730 = ~(After her outburst, she shakes her head and leans into you, obviously wanting to be held.)~
@5731 = ~(take the hint and hold her close) I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm afraid that's the way it's going to be... people will always need my help, and I will always give it to them. But that shouldn't get in the way of the two of us. I just want to help others. I love you. And therein lies the difference.~
@5732 = ~(hold her close to you) And I want all those things too! We just have to be patient. And whether you realise it or not, you will always come first. (smile) You always have, ever since I first met you.~
@5733 = ~(She narrows her eyes at you, and you notice the end of her tail begin to twitch.) I'm not trying to be difficult, <CHARNAME>, and you know full well I'd be miserable stuck in Sudanessellar without you. Although when you are like this, I do begin to wonder exactly why.~
@5734 = ~Fade, why don't you just tell me what is wrong, rather than dancing around the issue? I'm not a mind reader!~
@5735 = ~I think I know what's bothering you, but this is the life I choose--I would hope it's your choice as well. I don't want to force you into travelling, although if this is the way you feel about it, I fear it will always be an obstacle we will have to face.~
@5736 = ~When I'm being like what? You're the one who's complaining, not me!~
@5737 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm being serious! (Despite herself, she gives a small smile.) And since I know what you're like, I'm NOT going to rise to such an obvious bait.~
@5738 = ~(sigh) I suppose it's time to get used to being forced yet again, no doubt, to fight for the rights of others when we could be spending some time together alone. Great.~
@5739 = ~Okay, joking aside, what's wrong? At least we are together, which is more than some people ever have.~
@5740 = ~Oh, come on, my love! What could be better? Are you telling me you would have been happy staying in Suldanessellar, with no adventure to look forward to?~
@5741 = ~I do know how you feel, Fade, and I suppose I'm sorry. It seems as if I'm never destined to have any time for myself... for us.~
@5742 = ~I suppose not. This one seems to be tailor-made for you, doesn't it? Still, it doesn't make it any easier to deal with... I never, ever thought I'd want to swap a life of adventure and conquest for one of blissful monogamy, but here I am, lamenting the loss of our cosy privacy!~
@5743 = ~(smile) See what you're doing to me? I'd never have lived it down, if I were still in the Guild. They'd all say I'd gone soft!~
@5744 = ~(She takes your hand.) Lead on then, my brave and thoroughly persuasive knight. You know I'll follow you anywhere. I would say to the Hells and back, but since we've already done that... (She grins and kisses your hand.)~
@5745 = ~(sigh) I know... but it doesn't make it any easier to deal with. I never, ever thought I'd want to swap a life of adventure and conquest for one of blissful monogamy, but here I am, lamenting the loss of our cosy privacy!~
@5746 = ~Even from the start? That is indeed more than I could ever have hoped for the two of us. I still sometimes have to pinch myself to remind me this is all not just a dream... that I have indeed ensnared you!~
@5747 = ~I never, ever thought I'd be the one to swap a life of adventure and conquest for one of blissful monogamy, but here I am, lamenting the loss of our cosy privacy!~
@5748 = ~(She snorts rather derisively and turns away from you.) So that is how you feel. Forever the practical one, aren't you, <CHARNAME>? Can't lose you head, let alone your heart. I am only yearning to be with you, nothing more. Although sometimes I really do wonder exactly why.~
@5749 = ~I'm not complaining, <CHARNAME>! I just want to be able to spend a little bit of time with you minus the mud, bad food and frequent bloody battles! Is that so bad?~
@5750 = ~A sweet, if rather rambling, sentiment, but not very practical. Sometimes we all have to share, and we cannot hoard people and their affections as if they were gold. What we have is truly special, I know this, but I also have responsibilities elsewhere.~
@5751 = ~If you had three wishes, what would they be?~
@5752 = ~I don't need to wish for anything, Fade. I already have everything I could ever want.~
@5753 = ~What the... that's the stupidest thing any one has ever asked me! Why are you bothering me with that nonsense now?~
@5754 = ~I don't know. Why, do you have three in mind?~
@5755 = ~Three wishes? Let me see... I suppose the whole "wealth, health and happiness" package would do me fine.~
@5756 = ~Hmmm... let me think... I can have anything I like? Anything at all?~
@5757 = ~But surely there are other things you want? A slightly more peaceful life, perhaps? People to stop trying to kill you because of what you are? A more comfortable place to rest your head at night?~
@5758 = ~They are all good things, but I wouldn't wish for them. One of these days, I am sure those things will happen. It is just a matter of being patient.~
@5759 = ~Good point! Although I would like to add one more... maybe I can exchange the comfortable bed wish?~
@5760 = ~(grin at her and eye her cleavage) But I already have a *most* comfortable place to rest my head at night... why would I want anywhere else?~
@5761 = ~Come now, <CHARNAME>, this is only a bit of fun! Everything has been so... serious recently. I thought it would be nice to be able to talk, you know, like we used to.~
@5762 = ~I'm sorry, Fade. I don't mean to be grumpy, I'm just not in the mood for such things right now. Maybe another time.~
@5763 = ~Things change, Fade. We used to be able to talk rubbish to each other because we were simply looking for an excuse to talk to each other. Now we have each other, we don't need to talk rubbish anymore.~
@5764 = ~Everything is indeed serious, hence the reason why I am not in the mood for frivolous talk. I'm sorry, but that is the truth.~
@5765 = ~Me? I don't know. I only have one wish, really--that we will be together forever. I don't really care about the material stuff anymore. As long I have you, I have everything I could ever want.~
@5766 = ~(She looks thoughtful and then grins.) Although some kind of portable, comfortable bed would be nice...~
@5767 = ~Then your wish is my command, because I'm not going anywhere.~
@5768 = ~I can only agree with you there! If it's not the hard ground, we're sleeping in scratchy, bug-ridden tavern beds... I'd near enough sell my soul for the simple luxury of a nice, comfortable bed!~
@5769 = ~You, not care about material stuff? Now I never, ever thought I'd hear *you* say such a thing!~
@5770 = ~(grin at her and eye her cleavage) I don't need to wish for a comfy bed... I already have a *most* comfortable place to rest my head at night... why would I want anywhere else?~
@5771 = ~I would say you already have the "health and wealth" side tied up. I've never known anyone as vital as you are, and you certainly aren't lacking in the gold department. That only leaves the happiness part...~
@5772 = ~(grin) Fade, I'm perfectly happy with you--don't fret! It's the rest of my life I now have to sort out.~
@5773 = ~I may not be lacking in gold, but I would beg to differ on the "health" bit. Being a Bhaalspawn means I may be physically healthy, but in other areas...~
@5774 = ~Seems like you're my little djinni, as I've already had my three wishes granted! As you say, I'm healthy, wealthy and perfectly happy right now. I have adventure, and I have you. What more could I want?~
@5775 = ~(She looks at you shrewdly, a slightly mischievous smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.) Yes, anything... within reason, of course!~
@5776 = ~In that case, I think I'll have the basic package--health, wealth and happiness.~
@5777 = ~Within reason, huh? Bugger--that squashes my ultimate wish then, doesn't it?~
@5778 = ~So... does you, a big jar of honey and a hopeful expression fall into the bounds of "within reason"? (grin)~
@5779 = ~(sigh) Yes, I know... you keep reminding me! I just thought it would be nice to do a bit of hypothetical dreaming, rather than having to concentrate on all the doom and gloom that is going on around us.~
@5780 = ~Okay, point taken! If I had to choose, I think I would have the basic package--health, wealth and happiness.~
@5781 = ~Fair enough--you choose, then! Do you have any three particular wishes in mind?~
@5782 = ~All right, all right! I get your point! So, three wishes... hmmm... let me think... and I can have anything I like? Anything at all?~
@5783 = ~(She looks at you shrewdly, a slightly mischievous smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.) Yes, of course you can... within reason, of course!~
@5784 = ~Of course it's within reason! Why, what do you think I am going to exchange it for?~
@5785 = ~(Fade rolls her eyes.) <CHARNAME>... don't make me hurt you!~
@5786 = ~Okay, okay, I'll be serious! So, three wishes... I suppose the whole "health, wealth and happiness" package would do me fine.~
@5787 = ~Okay, point taken, I'll be good! Let me see... I must admit, I'm not sure. Do you have three in mind?~
@5788 = ~What? Would you rather I say they were horrible and that I had no interest in them whatsoever?~
@5789 = ~(leer at her) Oh, is that a threat or a promise?~
@5790 = ~Well... okay. I just thought it would be nice--it seems like we have less and less nice things to talk about nowadays.~
@5791 = ~But the rubbish was fun... I never used to know what you were going to say next. I used to look forward to our little "rubbish" conversations. I liked the fact that we could talk nonsense as well as about the serious stuff. It seems a shame that we can't do it now.~
@5792 = ~It may be the truth, but that is no reason for you to cut out the bits of your life that aren't serious, <CHARNAME>! Ah well, talk to me once your dour mood has lifted... you know where I am.~
@5793 = ~(Fade grins at you and links her arm with yours.) That's *exactly* what I wanted to hear! Now on to my second wish...~
@5794 = ~Within reason, Fade--I'm not stupid! No matter how strong my feelings for you are, I am leery of giving a Fey'ri with a broad sense of humour licence to run riot in the wish department!~
@5795 = ~I wait with bated breath, ready to fulfil your every desire, my sweetest, most delectable Fade. And I mean your *every* desire...~
@5796 = ~Cheater--you've already picked your second wish! You said you wanted a comfortable place to sleep at night. This is your third and last wish!~
@5797 = ~I've almost forgotten what it's like to have completely clean sheets. Tavern beds, no matter how much gold you pay, are never quite like your own, are they?~
@5798 = ~No, they aren't. When I think all of the times I eschewed the bed option when I was a kid to pursue the "excitement" of sleeping outside...~
@5799 = ~Ah well, there's worse things than tavern beds. We could all be really unlucky and end up sleeping inside a dragon's belly, if you get my meaning!~
@5800 = ~Just think, when all of this is over, we can go and spend some of our hard-won gold and buy a bed fit for a king... how wonderful would that be? By all the gods, I swear that once we have bought it, I'll not leave it for a tenday!~
@5801 = ~If there is one thing you have taught me, it's that whilst they are nice, there are more important things in life than mere baubles.~
@5802 = ~It does my heart good to hear you say that, Fade. As you say, jewels are nice, but nothing compares to the really precious things in life.~
@5803 = ~What? Come on now... where's that magpie spirit of yours gone? I thought the pursuit of wealth and all its trappings was what you lived for?~
@5804 = ~(grin) But mere baubles are nice too, aren't they? Oh, bless you Fade, I know I am teasing you, but the odd coin and shiny gem still mysteriously finds its way into your possession, doesn't it?~
@5805 = ~I wasn't compliment-fishing, <CHARNAME>. And as for the rest of your life--it'll come, eventually. You've never been one to just sit there and let life pass you by!~
@5806 = ~You've got that right! It just seems that every time I'm within a hair's breadth of sorting myself out, something else comes along to mess it up for me!~
@5807 = ~Heh, you can compliment me all you wish, but you know that isn't true. If it was, I'd have sorted this lot out by now and we'd be having a nice, expensively comfortable holiday somewhere exotic.~
@5808 = ~I really do hope so. Sometimes I look at myself and wonder what happened to that innocent boy who left Candlekeep all that time ago...~
@5809 = ~<CHARNAME>, don't say that. You've coped with things that would break a lesser man--you are simply the strongest person I have ever met. I know I would have gone mad a long time ago if I was faced with the trials you've had to endure.~
@5810 = ~Don't doubt your own strength, my love. You yourself have faced things that give me nightmares, and I wasn't there to experience them!~
@5811 = ~Yes, well, that's a matter of opinion. You don't go berserk and change into something hostile and spiky when faced with stressful situations, do you?~
@5812 = ~I'm only strong for one reason... because I have people to be strong for. Without that, I would have given up a long time ago.~
@5813 = ~(Fade smiles at you, drags your arm around her shoulders and nuzzles your cheek.) Either I'm the luckiest girl alive... or you're the easiest man in the entire Realms to please!~
@5814 = ~Oh, you're definitely the luckiest girl. I mean, look at what you've got--me!~
@5815 = ~Easy to please? Me? I don't think so, Fade. Do you think I'd be putting myself through all of this if I was easy to please?~
@5816 = ~(grin) If it's that easy, come here and please me!~
@5817 = ~Why is that, then? And before you answer, I would think very, very carefully about what you are going to say next...~
@5818 = ~Uh, okay, maybe I'll keep that one to myself! How about you, then? Do you have three wishes in mind?~
@5819 = ~Well, there is this one little thing...~
@5820 = ~(grin) Might do... but that doesn't really constitute a "wish", does it? I mean, wishes are supposed to be for things that you can't easily obtain...~
@5821 = ~So, let me see if I understand you correctly. I don't have to wish for the honey thing, because you'd do it anyway?~
@5822 = ~Well, as long as the honey thing remains in the running, I'm good! How about you, then? Do you have three wishes in mind?~
@5823 = ~Well, there is this one other little thing...~
@5824 = ~(grin) In that case, I suppose the whole "health, wealth and happiness" package would do me fine.~
@5825 = ~When it comes to you, I don't know! Oh, go on then... what would you exchange it for?~
@5826 = ~I would exchange it for a lifetime's worth of happiness with you. Is that within reason?~
@5827 = ~On second thought, I think I'll tell you later. Then I can show you what I mean... so you know exactly what I'm on about.~
@5828 = ~Well, I... err... of course I... that's not the point here! I asked you what you're three wishes would be, not for an opinion on my cleavage!~
@5829 = ~But I *like* giving opinions on your cleavage. It gives me the perfect excuse to have a good old rummage.~
@5830 = ~Oh, okay, I'll be good. So, three wishes... I suppose the whole "health, wealth and happiness" package would do me fine.~
@5831 = ~(sigh) Spoilsport. Oh, I have no idea. What about you? Do you have three wishes in mind?~
@5832 = ~When you're in this kind of mood? It's a promise, no doubt! Now, are you going to drag your mind out of the gutter, or am I going to have to find a convenient cold lake to throw you into?~
@5833 = ~Okay, I'll be good. So, three wishes... I suppose the whole "health, wealth and happiness" package would do me fine.~
@5834 = ~(grin) Convenient cold lake, I'm afraid...~
@5835 = ~Uh, okay, point taken, considering I intend to stay *dry* at the moment! How abut you, since you brought it up? Do you have three wishes in mind?~
@5836 = ~Oh, you're not playing fair! If these are wishes, I should get what I want.~
@5837 = ~(She smiles at you and rather seductively wraps her arms around your neck.) I'm sure it would work to your advantage, too...~
@5838 = ~Ohhh, you little temptress! Come on then. I know I may live to regret this, but what's your wish?~
@5839 = ~(grin) And I'm supposed to fall for that, am I? Knowing you, you'd wish for me to do the housework for ever and ever, so you don't have to lift a finger. I know you too well, my dear, shifty little minx that you are.~
@5840 = ~Hmmm... I'm sure it would! But you don't need anything special to grant wishes like that, you know.~
@5841 = ~Oh really? Anything? Anything at all?~
@5842 = ~(She smiles at you and rather seductively wraps her arms around your neck.) Well then... give me the rest of the day to think, as they say, "long and hard" about exactly what my *every* desire is, and exactly how you can fulfil them...~
@5843 = ~Third? No way! I didn't actually *wish* for the more comfortable place to sleep--I just mentioned it in passing. It wasn't a bona fide wish!~
@5844 = ~And do you think a Djinni or whatever would take that as an excuse? You said you wanted a comfortable place to sleep at night, so now you're on your third wish. Last wish, Fade. Only one wish left... better make it a good one.~
@5845 = ~Well, in that case, you have to make a very, very good wish to counteract the rather frivolous comment about comfortable places to sleep then, won't you? If you can come up with a really good wish, I'll allow you to rescind the bed wish, okay?~
@5846 = ~(Fade's countenance softens all of a sudden, and she smiles at you.) You used to thing sleeping outside was adventurous? That's very... innocent of you, <CHARNAME>.~
@5847 = ~Yes, I suppose it is. But I was just a child... it was a great adventure. Imoen would sometimes come with me and we'd lie on top of the little hillock just outside Candlekeep's gates and pretend to be heroes of legend, and that the local wildlife was great dragons coming to attack the town. Gorion of course kept a close eye on us, but we thought ourselves ever so brave.~
@5848 = ~Did you ever do anything like that? No, I suppose that's a stupid question, isn't it. I'm sorry, Fade. I sometimes forget you didn't have the idyllic childhood I had.~
@5849 = ~(chuckle) Yes, I do get your meaning. I suppose we should be more grateful for all the things we do have, rather than spending our time wishing on stars. People seem to preoccupy themselves with how they wish life was, and forget to live the life they actually have.~
@5850 = ~Well, I don't plan on doing that. I don't want to miss any of the moments that we have together, for surely they are the most precious things in the world, more precious than mere baubles and faerie-dreams.~
@5851 = ~I never, ever thought I'd hear you say that there are things more precious than baubles. What of your love of material things?~
@5852 = ~(say nothing, just draw her to you and kiss her)~
@5853 = ~Even if you wanted to leave, I wouldn't let you. Oh, how I look forward to the day when I have you all to myself for a whole tenday!~
@5854 = ~Me too. Can't you just imagine it? Breakfast in bed, sunlight streaming in through the cracks in the curtains, no one else to bother us... it'll be heaven!~
@5855 = ~So, back to your previous question... does that constitute a wish? For us to have a whole tenday to ourselves where no one else can bother us?~
@5856 = ~Then we are indeed the richest people on all Faerun, and all this talk about wishes is futile nonsense, for we have everything we could ever wish for.~
@5857 = ~Although, if you ever do come across, say, a beautiful diamond or ruby necklace, I wouldn't say no...~
@5858 = ~Ahhh, now there's the Fade I know and most definitely love! Even when she's trying to be philosophical, it'll forever be about the shiny and above all *expensive* things in life.~
@5859 = ~Fade, I know you may find this hard to believe, but unlike you, diamond and ruby necklaces do not often find their way into my pockets!~
@5860 = ~Again with the expensive stuff... Oh, bless you, I know I am teasing you, but forever will the odd coin and shiny gem still mysteriously find its way into your possession, won't it?~
@5861 = ~(chuckle) It's still there! I suppose I have just realised that I should be more grateful of all the things we do have, rather than spending my time in the pursuit of material gain, of dreaming that the next haul will indeed be "the big one". People seem to preoccupy themselves with how they wish life was, and forget to live the life they actually have...~
@5862 = ~Well, I don't plan on doing that anymore. I don't want to miss any of the moments that we have together, for surely they are the most precious things in the world, more precious than mere baubles and faerie-dreams. You alone have taught me that, <CHARNAME>, and I will be forever grateful to you for that.~
@5863 = ~I'm not perfect, <CHARNAME>. If people don't look after their coins and baubles properly and accord them the respect they deserve, then I'm going to take advantage of that situation! Coins are meant to be spent, and jewels meant to be worn, after all.~
@5864 = ~Ahhh, so you are liberating them from a horrible existence, sitting in a locked chest? Stealing them is in fact an act of kindness?~
@5865 = ~(sigh) I'm never going to change your attitude to that, am I? No matter what I say.~
@5866 = ~Spoken like a true magpie! It's a wonder you weren't a Guildmistress with that attitude.~
@5867 = ~But still, you pick yourself up and carry on. You've coped with things that would break a lesser man--you are simply the strongest person I have ever met! I know I would have gone mad a long time ago if I was faced with the trials you've had to endure.~
@5868 = ~There's always time for that later, <CHARNAME>. I think you're coping magnificently with everything life as thrown at you--such things would indeed have broken a lesser man! You are simply the strongest person I have ever met. I know I would have gone mad a long time ago if I was faced with the trials you've had to endure.~
@5869 = ~He is still there... he's just a little buried at the moment. Although I never knew him, I can just imagine what he would have been like. For all you have faced, you have a very sweet and considerate side, one that I for one am glad to have met and experienced. You alone have taught me to believe in people, and for that I will be forever grateful.~
@5870 = ~But listen to me rambling again... we still have much to face.~
@5871 = ~After all you have been through, I suppose it was inevitable that the innocent boy you once were would disappear, but it has been replaced by a strength I have never seen in anyone else. You have taught me to be myself, no matter what, and for that I will be forever grateful.~
@5872 = ~It was not strength that got me through those dark days, <CHARNAME>, but Keita and a rage; a sense of violence that I am now ashamed of.~
@5873 = ~I once thought that the ability to tear your opponents' throat out with your teeth, to make them cower before you, was the epitome of strength. Now I know differently--strength comes from defeating your personal demons and being able to face each new day and each new challenge positively. You and you alone taught me that... and I will forever be grateful.~
@5874 = ~To know that in whatever I face, I have you by my side is now what keeps me strong.~
@5875 = ~<CHARNAME>, that only happened once or twice! You now know how to control the Slayer--you have nothing to fear from it. I certainly do not fear it anymore! You should be proud of your accomplishments; I know I am.~
@5876 = ~Whether you like it or not, you have a strength about you, an aura that could lead armies. But instead, here you are, by my side. And for that I am most grateful... most grateful indeed.~
@5877 = ~And that has to be your greatest strength of all--that you are willing to sacrifice all for those who love you. And believe me, it is not just me that does; I think everyone here, no matter what they say, holds you in the highest esteem--why else would they still be here?~
@5878 = ~You cheeky sod! (She cuffs you playfully round your head, using the contact as an excuse to pull you closer to her. For a moment, she studies your face, and then leans forward and kisses the tip of your nose.)~
@5879 = ~Although you do have a point... Maybe later I should make it quite clear how lucky I think I am to have you, eh?~
@5880 = ~Okay, that's a fair point. But still, you always pick yourself up and carry on! You've coped with things that would break a lesser man--you are simply the strongest person I have ever met! I know I would have gone mad a long time ago if I was faced with the trials you've had to endure.~
@5881 = ~(Fade grins rather lasciviously and winks at you.) Now *that's* more like the <CHARNAME> I know... although I think it maybe wise to hold off that request until later? That'll also give me some time to think, as they say, "long and hard" about exactly what I could do to please you...~
@5882 = ~Hmmm... maybe this whole conversation has the potential to go beyond all the laws of decency, and would be much better discussed at a later, definitely more *private* time?~
@5883 = ~Because if you're going to say some of the things I suspect you're going to say, it'll give me some time to think, as they say, "long and hard" about exactly what I could do to make those particular wishes come true. (wink)~
@5884 = ~(laugh) What is it with you and the honey thing, anyway? There are much worse things in this world that you could ask me to do...~
@5885 = ~I know, why don't we go and see if we can find a market somewhere? Considering it *is* one of your wishes...~
@5886 = ~Of... of course that is within reason! That is just the sweetest thing.~
@5887 = ~Oh, really? You're going to show me?~
@5888 = ~(She smiles at you and rather seductively wraps her arms around your neck.) That certainly gives me something to look forward to. I have no doubt I shall be thinking, as they say, "long and hard" about exactly what it is you have in store for me!~
@5889 = ~Rummage? Rummage?! <CHARNAME>, I'm going to walk away now and pretend we haven't had this conversation, okay?~
@5890 = ~(mutter) Rummage, I ask you... I'll give him "rummage"--makes me sound like a bloody backpack! You rummage in your pockets for loose coins; you do NOT rummage around inside your loved one's armour...~
@5891 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, you are by far the most dreadful male I have ever met! Your mind can be so one-track sometimes it's positively in a ravine.~
@5892 = ~(smirk) Still, I suppose that does work to my advantage sometimes. Come on, my little love-demigod. You've got a prophecy to fulfil... along with other things!~
@5893 = ~Hmmm... my wish... now let me see...~
@5894 = ~(She smiles at you and rather seductively wraps her arms around your neck.) I think I need the rest of the day to think, as they say, "long and hard" about exactly what this most important of wishes will be, don't you?  Just so I know *exactly* how you can fulfil them...~
@5895 = ~(laugh) Indeed! Let's forget all that intimate nonsense--what I really want to wish for is a nice, expensive meal, a long, hot bath and you to wash out my clothes for me so I don't have to!~
@5896 = ~(smirk) Oh, and the obvious full body massage as well, of course--that goes without saying! It can't *all* be housekeeping, can it?~
@5897 = ~Now, that depends *entirely* on what it is you think my wish would be, <CHARNAME>! You should never assume anything when faced with the rather broad imagination of a Fey'ri female! You never know what nasty, horrible little furtive things I could get you up to...~
@5898 = ~(Fade narrows her eyes at you and a slightly cruel smile touches her lips.) Only one left, and I have to make it count, huh? Foolish male, challenging the rather broad imagination of a Fey'ri female! You never know what nasty, furive and above all *horrible* little things I could get you up to...~
@5899 = ~(With a decidedly lascivious grin, she flicks her tail at you and winks.) Just give me time to think of a suitable punishme-- I mean, wish...~
@5900 = ~Hmmm... a better wish than the bed wish... now let me see...~
@5901 = ~(She smiles at you and rather seductively wraps her arms around your neck.) I think I need the rest of the day to think, as they say, "long and hard" about exactly what would constitute as more important, don't you?  One so good that it'll make you realise that sleep, much less in a comfortable place, is sometimes entirely unnecessary...~
@5902 = ~You had such an idyllic childhood, <CHARNAME>... it kind of makes me realise exactly what the "civilised" races have got going for them. Once I would have thought you weak for such frivolities, but now, seeing you recollect such memories so fondly when I recollect my own with such hatred, I can see who is the richer.~
@5903 = ~I hope our child has half the childhood you had, my love--one full of carefree days full of imagination and fun.~
@5904 = ~It's okay, I don't begrudge you your childhood--I actually like hearing you speak of it. Our formative years were so far apart, we might as well have been living on different worlds. Listening to you gives me hope, I suppose; hope that our child will be able to follow in its father's footsteps rather than its mother's.~
@5905 = ~I hope our child has half the childhood you had, my love; one full of carefree days full of imagination and fun.~
@5906 = ~It's okay, I don't begrudge you your childhood--I actually like hearing you speak of it. I myself may not have such memories to draw on, but I can still share yours... and the fact that I can enjoy them makes me realise that I am not the monster I once was.~
@5907 = ~(You feel Fade smile as she accepts your kiss. After a while, she pulls back from you slightly, breaking contact, and looks at you with a rather indulgent smile.)~
@5908 = ~Never one to let an opportunity like that to slip away, are you <CHARNAME>? I suppose it's when you stop kissing me like that that I should worry.~
@5909 = ~Never fear--you will never have to worry, for I will never, ever stop kissing you like this!~
@5910 = ~(grin) And why would I want to stop kissing you? Especially when I get as much out of it as you do!~
@5911 = ~Heaven, <CHARNAME>? No, not really... I've already got heaven right here, beside me.~
@5912 = ~What you describe is some kind of paradise--one that I fully intend to create at some point in our lives, no matter what anyone else thinks, nor how much they try to stop us!~
@5913 = ~I suppose it does, although I would rather have us together, forever happy with each other, with the occasional outside disturbance, than just a tenday with no disturbances at all.~
@5914 = ~So there, that is my wish... and it's one that I hope can be fulfilled without too much trouble.~
@5915 = ~(She tries to look affronted, but you cannot help but notice she is trying desperately to suppress a grin.) Okay, okay, I admit it--there will forever be a role for the shiny bauble in my life. I guess I've substituted jewels for wanton cruelty in my repertoire of my life's "wants". It's just that coins are *meant* to be spent, and gems are *meant* to be worn!~
@5916 = ~Well, they only occasionally find their way into mine! I mean, I can't help it if some rich wench decides they look better in a jewellery box rather than wearing them, which is the proper use for jewels. Coins are *meant* to be spent, and gems are *meant* to be worn!~
@5917 = ~Stop making fun, <CHARNAME>! I'm much, much better than I used to be. I mean, I can walk by an open window now without having to go and investigate what's inside.~
@5918 = ~(She grins and laces her fingers through yours.) C'mon, we'd better get going. Places to be, people to see, shiny baubles to nick...~
@5919 = ~But you have, <CHARNAME>! I'm much, much better than I used to be. I mean, I can walk by an open window now without having to go and investigate what's inside.~
@5920 = ~(chuckle) I have no interest in that life, <CHARNAME>! Leading a Guild is far too much like work. All that paperwork, people trying to kill you all the time, having to maintain a distance between yourself and your guildmembers...~
@5921 = ~No, I made the right choice. Leaving the Shadow Thieves to follow you was the right thing to do--I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. You're the best thing that has ever happened to me, without question.~
@5922 = ~Come on. Let's get this prophecy over and done with so we can get on with the rest of our lives.~
@5923 = ~(She wraps her arms around you and nuzzles your neck.) I hope you never forget you said that, <CHARNAME>... not ever.~
@5924 = ~(chuckle) Not that I would ever let you forget it! You're the best thing that has ever happened to me, without question.~
@5925 = ~(She glances down and grins wickedly.) Oh yes... so you did, <CHARNAME>. Well, it seems a real shame to let such, err, "magnificence" go to waste, but I know we've got a lot to do...~
@5926 = ~Yes, we do. Maybe later, huh? When we have a rather more legitimate reason to rest.~
@5927 = ~(blush) Fade! What have I said about making such comments? It's not... not ladylike!~
@5928 = ~Magnificence, eh? As in "filled with magnificence" or "magnificent in stature", I wonder.~
@5929 = ~But I think that is more than a legitimate reason to call a rest break! Okay... later, then. It'll give me time to think, as they say, "long and hard" about exactly what we can get up to later...~
@5930 = ~(laugh) You manage to seduce someone with a succubus heritage, keep her satisfied and *still* you get embarrassed at the slightest mention of anything "naughty"! Bless you, <CHARNAME>!~
@5931 = ~Come on then, chivalrous one... there's plenty of time for you to be embarrassed later. Let's continue on.~
@5932 = ~(It has been a long day, and you feel you need a little bit of time to yourself. After a short while, Fade comes and stands by your side, a rather familiar half-smile on her face.)~
@5933 = ~So... are we finally stopping? (She wraps her arms around your waist.)~
@5934 = ~Yes. I'm glad you came to find me.~
@5935 = ~I came over here to get a bit of peace and quiet, Fade. I'm sorry, but I need a bit of time to myself right now.~
@5936 = ~(A slow smile spreads across her face, and she tilts her head so he can kiss you properly. Slowly her hand snakes across your stomach, and she begins to play with the laces of your trousers.) Close your eyes.~
@5937 = ~(grin) Okay...~
@5938 = ~Fade, now isn't really the time for this. Maybe later.~
@5939 = ~(She kisses you on the cheek.) Sure I can't tempt you?~
@5940 = ~Sure. But thanks for thinking of me.~
@5941 = ~Well, if you put it that way... go on.~
@5942 = ~No peeking...~
@5943 = ~(As you close your eyes, she begins to kiss the back of your neck, and slowly continues to unlace your trousers. You feel yourself responding naturally to her touch; gradually she draws you out and encircles you with her hand.)~
@5944 = ~(Her strokes are firm, and every time you feel yourself building up, she slows down, delaying your climax. You feel her move away from you slightly, and gasp as you feel her replace her hand with her mouth. At this, you cannot help the build, and this time she allows you your release.)~
@5945 = ~(Once you have calmed enough to open your eyes, you see her giving you a most wicked smile as she daintily wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. With a mock sigh and an impish grin, she begins to unlace her own trousers.)~
@5946 = ~My turn now...~
@5947 = ~All right... although it's your loss! (grin)~
@5948 = ~Any time, <CHARNAME>. (She winks and blows you a kiss.)~
@5949 = ~Isn't it funny? Just a few months ago, we were near strangers. Now look at us!~
@5950 = ~Is that funny-strange or funny-ha ha, Fade?~
@5951 = ~I suppose it is. We've accomplished much since we first met, haven't we?~
@5952 = ~I know. I think back to the awful things I used to say to you and cringe.~
@5953 = ~Oh, very amusing. Always the bloody jester, aren't you, <CHARNAME>?~
@5954 = ~Yep, always! That's why you love me so much.~
@5955 = ~I would have thought you'd be used to it by now, honeykitten!~
@5956 = ~I was actually being serious... well, kind of. Do you remember all the awful things I used to say to you? I look back on that now and just cringe.~
@5957 = ~That we have. But there again, considering all we've been through, I suppose it was inevitable we should become closer.~
@5958 = ~Why do you say that? Is anything bothering you?~
@5959 = ~I suppose so. It definitely makes sense. I seriously doubt that my woeful attempts at engaging you in conversation had anything to do with the development of your feelings towards me! I look back on that now and just cringe.~
@5960 = ~I think we would have become closer no matter the situation. We were made for each other, Fade!~
@5961 = ~You, cringe? Why? You've done nothing to be ashamed of.~
@5962 = ~Oh, haven't I? All those dreadful excuses I used to make up, just to talk to you! Maybe I should have just walked right up to you from the beginning and made my intentions clear. I would have made life a lot easier!~
@5963 = ~Don't you realise how tongue-tied you used to make me, Fade? Each time you spoke to me, my stomach felt like it was housing a whole battalion of butterflies! I'm surprised you couldn't hear them flapping away.~
@5964 = ~Oh yes I have! I've lost count the amount of times I wanted the ground to swallow me up. I nearly gave you up as a lost cause! (grin) Although I suppose you gave me enough hints to keep me keen. after all, we wouldn't be here together if I'd given up.~
@5965 = ~I'm *positive* you never used to be this cheeky when I first met you. Maybe I should try the "treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen" philosophy for a while...~
@5966 = ~So now who's the jester, eh? Behave yourself, woman!~
@5967 = ~I never used to be this cheeky when we first met because each time you spoke to me, my stomach felt like it was housing a whole battalion of butterflies! I'm surprised you couldn't hear them flapping away.~
@5968 = ~What do you mean, "try"?! You did it before quite successfully!~
@5969 = ~No... not really. I still have to pinch myself sometimes to remind me that all of this is indeed real. When I remember all those dreadful things I used to say to you, just in the hope you would notice me... I'm surprised you even gave me the time of day!~
@5970 = ~All the dreadful things *you* used to say? If that's the case, then I was about a hundred times worse. All those dreadful excuses I used to make up, just to talk to you! Maybe I should have just walked right up to you from the beginning and made my intentions clear. I would have made life a lot easier!~
@5971 = ~Y-you felt that way too? I thought it was just me! Do you realise how tongue-tied you used to make me, Fade? Each time you spoke to me, my stomach felt like it was housing a whole battalion of butterflies! I'm surprised you couldn't hear them flapping away.~
@5972 = ~Believe me, I know how you feel. I've lost count the amount of times I wanted the ground to swallow me up--I nearly gave you up as a lost cause! (grin) Although I suppose you gave me enough hints to keep me keen; after all, we wouldn't be here together if I'd given up.~
@5973 = ~Of course I gave you the time of day! I knew you'd fall into my clutches sooner or later.~
@5974 = ~No, nothing is bothering me, per se. I just find it a little odd at times how much three little words can change your life! When I remember all those dreadful things I used to say to you, just in the hope you would notice me... I'm surprised you even give me the time of day!~
@5975 = ~Considering I was "made" well before you were, it would have to have been a very fore-sighted deity indeed to have planned all of this.~
@5976 = ~But your sentiment is sweet. When I remember all those dreadful things I used to say to you, just in the hope you would notice me... I'm surprised you even give me the time of day!~
@5977 = ~That it would have done! (grin) But there again, the uncertainty did give everything a slight "piquancy". Never before have I pursued a male the way I did you! Normally... well, normally...~
@5978 = ~Normally... what?~
@5979 = ~(laugh) Normally you would have gone straight for the proverbial jugular!~
@5980 = ~Is "pursued" the right word, Fade? I've seen how reckless you can be. Considering how you kept me guessing for such a long while, I would have used the phrase "cautiously shadowed"!~
@5981 = ~Bless those butterflies--I know them well! There were plenty of times when they made me feel sick as hell. (laugh) Still, sometimes I miss those days.~
@5982 = ~You miss them? How come?~
@5983 = ~I know what you mean. Although I'd never change what we have, it certainly made life very interesting for a while!~
@5984 = ~You might, but I don't! I much prefer the stability of knowing you are mine, Fade.~
@5985 = ~I would never have let you give up. (grin) Never before have I pursued a male the way I did you! Normally... well, normally...~
@5986 = ~(grin) You honestly want me to behave myself? Really? I'm surprised, words like that coming from a man who begged me to...~
@5987 = ~Okay, okay, point taken, be quiet! I thought we said we wouldn't mention that again...?~
@5988 = ~(grin) Oh yeah... that. Heh heh, that was great!~
@5989 = ~I never "treated you mean"! I was just cautious! Never before have I pursued a male the way I did you! Normally... well, normally...~
@5990 = ~Well, really! You "knew I'd fall into your clutches", did you? Oh, ha ha, jester!~
@5991 = ~Well... normally, let's say I wouldn't have been quite so polite about it all.~
@5992 = ~Why did you treat me so differently? Surely I started out as just another conquest.~
@5993 = ~I don't think I want to know, Fade. I'm glad you've left that all behind.~
@5994 = ~You know, you could've just jumped me. I wouldn't have minded!~
@5995 = ~Me neither. (wink)~
@5996 = ~(laugh) Yes, I would have done. Sometimes it worries me how well you know me!~
@5997 = ~I knew you were different, even from the start. The way you presented yourself... there was something different about you--something intriguing, something that demanded a certain level of... of... respect.~
@5998 = ~I think that was the difference. I respected you, in a way I've never respected anyone before. I now suspect that is why I have never felt so strongly for another--; why I have never allowed myself to love another as I love you.~
@5999 = ~We did make it hard for ourselves, didn't we? I just didn't want to add you to the long list of screw-ups that I've made in my life, that's all.~
@6000 = ~Everything was just so... exciting then! Never before have I pursued a male the way I did you! Normally... well, normally...~
@6001 = ~It did indeed! Never knowing what was going to happen next... it certainty did give everything a slight "piquancy" at the time!~
@6002 = ~Never before have I pursued a male the way I did you! Normally... well, normally...~
@6003 = ~(grin) I am that! Nothing could ever stop me from loving you, <CHARNAME>. I am yours forever... whether you like it or not!~
@6004 = ~Yes... "that". I have to say, I didn't think a nice boy like you would even *know* about such things, much less suggest them.~
@6005 = ~Well, you know what they say about the nice ones...~
@6006 = ~It was, err, the heat of the moment, you know... I...~
@6007 = ~What, after being with a part-succubus all this time? You are my inspiration, my dear!~
@6008 = ~Hmmm... yes, "that". My stipulation still stands, you know. Only on birthdays and other special occasions.~
@6009 = ~Does the day having a "y" in it count as a special occasion?~
@6010 = ~Well, *I* thought it was a case of give and take, you know what I mean?~
@6011 = ~(grin) Yes, ma'am.~
@6012 = ~Ironically enough, you didn't. I knew what you were, obviously, and I knew you might be able to help me.~
@6013 = ~It was obvious to me from the start that you were different. The way you presented yourself... there was something different about you--something intriguing, something that demanded a certain level of... of... respect.~
@6014 = ~(smile) I am too. What we have... knowing that we worked at it... it just makes it all the more special.~
@6015 = ~Yes, we can have fun, but knowing there is a bond between us--one that feels so strong and unbreakable--makes all the difference. I would never want to go back to my old ways, not now, not after all you've shown and taught me.~
@6016 = ~No, I suppose not, considering what you were begging me to do the other day...~
@6017 = ~Uh, yeah, okay, be quiet! I thought we said we wouldn't mention that again...?~
@6018 = ~No, I suppose not. Especially if you normally go around propositioning people to do what you begged me to do the other day...~
@6019 = ~Indeed I do--they're the ones you have to watch the closest! They've always got some kind of nasty skeleton in their cupboard... (grin)~
@6020 = ~Yeah, I know "you, err...". It got everywhere. You ruined that nice new blanket!~
@6021 = ~Don't you try to blame your own horrid little fantasies on me! (grin) I'm just the facilitator...~
@6022 = ~(Fade tries to suppress a grin as she cuffs you round the ear.) No! The day having a "y" in it does NOT constitute a special occasion! If you think I'm doing that every single day, you've got another think coming! Bad <CHARNAME>!~
@6023 = ~(blush) Well, yes, of course, I mean... oh, okay, you win! (mutter) Like you usually do...~
@6024 = ~(She tries to give you a stern look, but fails miserably as she is obviously trying not to laugh.) Damn straight! And don't you forget it!~
@6025 = ~(Fade wraps her arms around your waist as you're walking and kisses your cheek.)~
@6026 = ~(grin and kiss her back)~
@6027 = ~What was that for?~
@6028 = ~(She smiles contentedly as she accepts your kiss.) <CHARNAME>, I've been thinking.~
@6029 = ~(grin) That's dangerous.~
@6030 = ~About what?~
@6031 = ~About me, I hope?~
@6032 = ~(grin) Do I need an excuse, sugarspawn?~
@6033 = ~Good point. (kiss her back)~
@6034 = ~(smile) No. Never.~
@6035 = ~Sugarspawn?!? I don't know whether to be amused or offended! That's terrible!~
@6036 = ~This is serious! You know that time I asked you about the future? Ever since then, something has been... playing on my mind.~
@6037 = ~<CHARNAME>... Do you think that you'll ever want... well... children?~
@6038 = ~Maybe, one day. Why, do you?~
@6039 = ~What are you trying to say, Fade? You're not... pregnant, are you?~
@6040 = ~Of course! Why? Does it worry you?~
@6041 = ~I don't think children are my thing.~
@6042 = ~You know that time I asked you about the future? Ever since then, something has been... playing on my mind.~
@6043 = ~Well... that depends. (grin) But what I really want to ask is... you know that time I asked you about the future? Ever since then, something has been... playing on my mind.~
@6044 = ~(She smiles contentedly and rests her head on your shoulder.) You have no idea what that means to me.~
@6045 = ~I need to ask you something, though. You know that time I asked you about the future? Ever since then, something has been... playing on my mind.~
@6046 = ~Well, if you can call me honeykitten, I can call you sugarspawn! Fair's fair.~
@6047 = ~I'm not sure, <CHARNAME>. Sometimes I think it might be nice, but then I contemplate on what I am... I think I'd be a terrible mother.~
@6048 = ~How can you say that? You don't know for sure.~
@6049 = ~I don't think you'd be a terrible mother. I know I wouldn't want anyone else to have my children.~
@6050 = ~I must admit, I never imagined that the mother of my children would have a tail... but we'll cope, Fade.~
@6051 = ~(She shakes her head emphatically, but does not catch your eye.) No! If I was, I'd be paying a certain dockside hedge-witch a visit and getting my gold back. I'm just thinking about, you know... one day. In the future.~
@6052 = ~You scared me for a moment there! I mean, maybe one day. But I'm not ready to be a father *quite* yet!~
@6053 = ~Oh, the future. I guess it would be quite irresponsible of us to have children now.~
@6054 = ~In the future... of course! A huge great big tribe of them, if possible. Why? Does it... worry you?~
@6055 = ~(shrug) I don't know. Kind of. Sometimes I think it would be nice, having something that we've created together, watching it grow up, teaching it all we've learnt...~
@6056 = ~But then I remember how terrible a mother *my* mother was, and I think that I should never be allowed to breed. I'd make an awful mother.~
@6057 = ~So... you've thought about us having children? Don't you think that's a bit premature? We haven't been together that long.~
@6058 = ~No, I suppose not. Kids are not conducive to adventuring... are they?~
@6059 = ~Fade, why bring this up? Do you want children?~
@6060 = ~You're not pregnant, are you? Is that why you've brought this up?~
@6061 = ~Not really. I mean, maybe in the future, but certainly not now. I'm not ready to be a father *quite* yet!~
@6062 = ~Oh, but I can. You see, I come from a long line of bad mothers. My mother was a bad mother; her mother was a bad mother... if you go back far enough, you're into full-blood Tan'ari territory, and I don't think they even know of the concept of maternal feeling.~
@6063 = ~I get... worried that I'll have a child and feel... nothing for it. That I won't want to care for it. And... and...~
@6064 = ~And... what?~
@6065 = ~Fade, you've already proven to me that you're capable of feeling great emotion. If you can love me, you'd be able to love our child. I'm sure of it.~
@6066 = ~Whoa, slow down! It's like you've planned this all in your head already, and you've decided it's going to be dreadful! Just... let nature take its course. We haven't been together that long.~
@6067 = ~Really? You'd be willing to subject your child to a Fey'ri heritage? To have a Fey'ri mother?~
@6068 = ~I come from a long line of bad mothers. My mother was a bad mother; her mother was a bad mother... if you go back far enough, you're into full-blood Tan'ari territory, and I don't think they even know of the concept of maternal feeling.~
@6069 = ~"We'd" cope? And... and what happens if your head gets turned by a younger, easier option? When I'm tired and bloated from bearing your children, nagging you every day?~
@6070 = ~Or what if your child is born with horns? Or wings? Or cloven hooves? How would you cope with that? You could just turn and leave... but I'd be left with it.~
@6071 = ~I'd never do that to you!~
@6072 = ~Children are a blessing, not the burden you've painted them to be! Don't be so pessimistic about such things.~
@6073 = ~My head would never be turned by anyone... ever. Not while I have you.~
@6074 = ~Do you think I haven't thought of my child having demonic traits? Of course I have! But please bear in mind you're talking to a Child of Bhaal. I think extraneous appendages should be the least of our worries. But it would be *our* child, and I would love it no matter what. Just like I love you. Unconditionally and forever.~
@6075 = ~But what would you do if it did happen? I may not be pregnant now, but you never know what might happen in the future.~
@6076 = ~Why is this bothering you so much? Do you want children?~
@6077 = ~Why have you even brought this up? Does the prospect of children worry you that much?~
@6078 = ~Fade, don't you think this is a bit premature? We haven't been together that long!~
@6079 = ~You sound disappointed. Why? Would you really be willing to subject your child to a Fey'ri heritage? To have a Fey'ri mother?~
@6080 = ~I know we haven't... but it could happen. Things can go wrong, and I'm the one who has to suffer the consequences. You could just walk away if you chose to, but I'd be stuck, holding the baby. And that... scares me.~
@6081 = ~That's not going to happen, okay? We'd cope. Together.~
@6082 = ~Stop second-guessing the future! None of this may happen. I may get killed in a battle tomorrow; you may meet someone who sweeps you off your feet, making you forget all about me! Just take the future as it comes. We can see what happens then.~
@6083 = ~Things could go wrong. And that would mean I'm the one who has to suffer the consequences. You could just walk away if you chose to, but I'd be stuck, holding the baby. And that... scares me.~
@6084 = ~I don't think you totally understand what I'm saying. I'm Fey'ri. Our child may be born with horns, or wings... or cloven hooves! How would you cope with that? You could just walk away if you chose to, but I'd be left holding the baby. That... scares me.~
@6085 = ~You say that now, but how about in 10 years' time? 5 years' time? A couple of months?~
@6086 = ~Fade, I can't give you any other answer to that other than this: I love you. Whether I will in 10 years' time, or 5 years' time, or a couple of months from now... I don't know. I intend to. Let's just enjoy what we have now.~
@6087 = ~I suppose I am being rather pessimistic, but it's something that has been playing on my mind for a while. How can what we've got... this kind of happiness... last? In my experience, something always comes along and screws it up for you.~
@6088 = ~She looks at you intently, and then blinks rapidly. She doesn't say anything for a moment, and then wraps her arms around your neck, holding you close to her.) I... I couldn't ask for any more from you, <CHARNAME>. You've already brought me so much happiness.~
@6089 = ~I suppose I was just waiting for the moment that the bubble would burst. I never even considered that the bubble might be strong enough to resist whatever is thrown at it.~
@6090 = ~(sigh) I guess you're right. I shouldn't worry so. I love you, <CHARNAME>, and that's all that matters.~
@6091 = ~(She looks a little stunned, but then holds you close to her.) I love you too. And thank you for being honest. You've already brought me so much happiness.~
@6092 = ~(Fade has been quiet all day; she seems subdued and even looks a little ill. Each time you look to her, she smiles. It is obvious she is trying to smile warmly, but it makes her look even more wan in your eyes.)~
@6093 = ~Darling? You aren't looking very well. Would you like to sit down and rest for a while?~
@6094 = ~What's up, honeykitten? You're really not looking well at all at the moment. Are you feeling sick at all? Do you want us to stop?~
@6095 = ~Okay, people... time to stop for a short rest!~
@6096 = ~(Initially she shakes her head; for some reason, she won't catch your eye. Finally she sighs and nods.) Yes, I suppose we had better stop. I am feeling a bit unwell... and I need to speak with you. Alone.~
@6097 = ~Okay... that sounds a bit ominous. But we'll stop and rest now.~
@6098 = ~Fade, what's wrong with you? You've been looking dreadful all day. If you're feeling unwell, you should have said!~
@6099 = ~Fair enough, we can stop. No problem--there's no rush. And then you can tell me what's wrong.~
@6100 = ~Yes, I would like to stop for a while. I am not feeling so good... and I need to speak with you. Alone.~
@6101 = ~(She sinks gratefully to the ground, but her visage remains one of worry. As you approach her she gives you that selfsame wan smile, but will not catch your eye.)~
@6102 = ~Thank you. I was feeling a little sick. C-can I speak with you? Alone?~
@6103 = ~Of course you can! What's bothering you? You look like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders.~
@6104 = ~Yes... of course you can. What do you want to tell me?~
@6105 = ~Yes, of course you can, but I think you should rest up a bit first. You really do look quite ill. Do you need some healing? I can arrange that, no problem.~
@6106 = ~(She sinks to the ground, her countenance one of worry and, to your concern, fear.) I am afraid what I have to tell you is a little ominous. For I have... I have... lied to you. And to myself. But I cannot remain in denial any longer. You have the right to know.~
@6107 = ~Fade, you're scaring me. What are you talking about?~
@6108 = ~Why... why do you look so fearfully at me, as if I would hurt you? You know I would never, ever do that! What is wrong?~
@6109 = ~You've *lied* to me? I... I can scarcely believe that. Why would you do a thing like that?~
@6110 = ~I don't think anything is wrong with me, per se, apart from worry. On one hand, I hope my suspicions are right, but there again, I hope I'm wrong...~
@6111 = ~But listen to me, babbling on. I... I am not making much sense. I just don't know how to tell you. I scarcely want to face up to it myself. I fear I... I have... lied to you, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry.~
@6112 = ~(She nods and sinks to the ground, wrapping her arms around herself. Your kindness seems only to worry her more.) I don't know where to begin. I hoped it wouldn't some to this; that my suspicions would be proven wrong, but it seems that this is not going to be the case.~
@6113 = ~I fear I... I have... lied to you, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry.~
@6114 = ~I don't know about the weight of the world... just the weight of being female. I don't know where to begin. I hoped it wouldn't some to this; that my suspicions would be proven wrong, but it seems that this is not going to be the case.~
@6115 = ~Being female? What does being female have to do with all this?~
@6116 = ~You have every right to be cautious... every right. I had hoped that this wouldn't come to this, that my suspicions were wrong, but I cannot remain in denial, for one way or another you *will* find out. Nature herself will make sure of that.~
@6117 = ~I've... I've lied to you, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry.~
@6118 = ~I fear healing will not help me, <CHARNAME>, for I don't think I'm actually ill.~
@6119 = ~And although rest would be welcome, I... I must speak with you first.~
@6120 = ~If you don't need healing, what is wrong with you? Fade, I must admit you're scaring me a bit. What are you talking about?~
@6121 = ~*You're* scared? Then imagine how I feel right now! Believe me, I don't want to do this to you, I really don't, but you are involved and so have a right to know.~
@6122 = ~I'm... I'm pregnant, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry.~
@6123 = ~Y-y-you're what? Excuse me... did I hear that correctly? You're pregnant? You're having a baby? What, now?~
@6124 = ~What? Are... are you sure? I mean, you could be wrong if you haven't seen a healer or whoever it is that deals with this kind of thing.~
@6125 = ~I'm going to be a daddy? Really? I'm going to be a... *daddy*? Whoo-hoo, I can't believe it! Oh, Fade, my darling, my sweet, is this really true? That we're having a baby?~
@6126 = ~Pregnant? Does that mean you're having a baby? When did that happen? How did that happen?~
@6127 = ~What in the Hells are you talking about? How can that have happened? I mean, we've always been careful... No! This can't be happening.~
@6128 = ~I can't help it. Considering everything, I... I don't know how to tell you! I don't want to hurt you, I don't want to lose you, but I fear I may after I tell you everything, and that scares me more than anything! But at the same time, you have the right to know.~
@6129 = ~I suppose I wanted to protect you from the truth, at least until I was completely sure myself. I never wanted to lie to you and I don't want to lose you, but I fear I may after I tell you everything. I had hoped my instinct was wrong and my body was playing tricks on me, what with everything we've been through, but it seems this is not to be the case.~
@6130 = ~I... I lied when I said I wasn't pregnant, <CHARNAME>. I am. I'm sorry.~
@6131 = ~Y-y-you did what? Excuse me... did I hear that correctly? You're pregnant? You're having a baby? What, now?~
@6132 = ~It has *everything* to do with this. Some see it as a gift, others a curse. Me, I'm falling down on the side of "curse" at the moment.~
@6133 = ~Believe me, I don't want to do this to you, I really don't, but you are involved and so have a right to know.~
@6134 = ~(Despite herself, Fade chuckles.) No, silly, not right now. In a while, I don't know when. In a few months' time, I suppose. So yes, you did hear correctly.~
@6135 = ~I can only apologise, <CHARNAME>. I thought about getting rid of it, but then I knew that would be unfair on you. You're the father, and so have a right to know what is going on.~
@6136 = ~You thought of getting rid of it? Why would you do that?~
@6137 = ~Oh, Fade, no wonder you've been looking so ill recently! You should never have burdened yourself with all this-- you should have realised I would support you in any decision you make. This is as much my fault as yours. And as much my problem.~
@6138 = ~Maybe you should have just got rid of it. I have enough on my plate at the moment without having brats to think about.~
@6139 = ~Fade, why are you apologising? Do I look disappointed? Okay, so this has happened a little bit earlier than I had expected, but that doesn't mean I'm any less pleased.~
@6140 = ~No, I haven't seen anyone, but I know. I keep having these weird dreams, and then I didn't bleed... then the sickness came, and the strange feeling of another.~
@6141 = ~I *know*, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry. I thought about getting rid of it, but then I knew that would be unfair on you. You're the father, and so have a right to know what is going on.~
@6142 = ~(She looks up at you, stunned. Then her face crumples as she bursts into tears.)~
@6143 = ~Fade, Fade, what is wrong? Please don't cry!~
@6144 = ~Why are you crying? I thought you'd cry if I wasn't happy about it all, but instead you cry now that I am! Fade, I'm ecstatic!~
@6145 = ~I suppose I'd better get used to such emotional outbursts, hadn't I? You have nothing to worry about, Fade! Please, dry your eyes.~
@6146 = ~Uhh... did I say something wrong?~
@6147 = ~I would hope you know how it happened, <CHARNAME>, considering you were the other party involved!~
@6148 = ~As for when... (sigh) I don't know. I forgot to take my dose once... I didn't think that the once would make a difference. How wrong I was.~
@6149 = ~I'm sorry. I thought about getting rid of it, but then I knew that would be unfair on you. You're the father, and so have a right to know what is going on.~
@6150 = ~Well, it is happening. And I don't know what to do. I thought about getting rid of it, but then I knew that would be unfair on you. You're the father, and so have a right to know what is going on. Although judging by your response, I almost wish I had just gotten rid of it.~
@6151 = ~Maybe that would have been for the best. I have enough on my plate at the moment without having brats to think about.~
@6152 = ~Oh gods, Fade, no! You can't go through something like this alone. No, this is as much my fault as it is yours, so I must step up and take responsibility for what is going on.~
@6153 = ~I don't know what to do either. I... I want to support you, though. In whatever decision you make.~
@6154 = ~I don't *want* a baby, <CHARNAME>! It's okay for you, you can play the role of doting father if you want to, but I'm the one who has to carry it, has to worry about it, has to push it out of my body and then take care of it... It's like I've turned against myself!~
@6155 = ~If only I hadn't been so stupid... if only I hadn't forgotten my dose! None of this would have happened.~
@6156 = ~I'm no expert at these things, but I'm sure a lot of first time mothers feel this way. I can't even imagine how it must be for you, and as you say, all I have to do is look on and watch my baby grow. But I will take care of it, and of you. I... I can't make you want this baby, Fade. I can only hope and pray you will come round to the idea.~
@6157 = ~How... how can you not want something that we have created together? This is the ultimate expression of what we feel for each other! Fade, please don't be frightened. I will always be there for you, and for our baby. We are a family now.~
@6158 = ~You mustn't blame yourself. You should never have burdened yourself with all this. You should have realised I would support you in any decision you make. This is as much my fault as yours. And as much my problem.~
@6159 = ~(She leans into you, grateful for your comfort. She says nothing for a while, and when she does respond, she sounds very small and very frightened.)~
@6160 = ~What are we going to do? How am I supposed to help you in your quest when I'm in this condition? I have no idea what I'm doing! I can't look after a baby... I can barely look after myself.~
@6161 = ~<CHARNAME>... maybe I should leave. Maybe I should go somewhere else; somewhere you don't have to worry about me...~
@6162 = ~That's enough of that talk. I adore you, and you're now the mother of my child. That makes you the single most important person in my life. Fade, please don't be frightened. I will always be there for you, and for our baby. We are a family now.~
@6163 = ~(sigh) My sweetest Fade. I'm no expert at these things, but I'm sure a lot of first time mothers feel this way. I can't even imagine how it must be for you. But I will take care of it, and of you, you can be sure of that. I... I can't make you want this baby, Fade. I can only hope and pray you will come round to the idea.~
@6164 = ~Then... then the decision is made for me. And of course, you're right. It is wrong to bring an unwanted and unloved child into this cruel world. I should have done this sooner. I shall go now and seek out the medication I need. Goodbye.~
@6165 = ~You're leaving? You can't leave! I may not want the baby, but I still want you!~
@6166 = ~Perhaps it is better if you didn't come back. I... I can't risk this happening again. I do love you, Fade, but maybe not a strongly as once I thought I did. Sorry.~
@6167 = ~I'm glad you see things my way. Maybe once the babe is gone, we can resume a normal life again.~
@6168 = ~Your enthusiasm for this only makes it all the more difficult for me! I don't *want* a baby, <CHARNAME>! It's okay for you, you can play the role of doting father if you want to, but I'm the one who has to carry it, has to worry about it, has to push it out of my body and then take care of it... It's like I've turned against myself!~
@6169 = ~(She hiccoughs and tries to dry her eyes on the edge of her tunic.) You really want this baby, don't you? You really, really do. Oh, <CHARNAME>, your enthusiasm for this only makes it all the more difficult for me, for I don't *want* a baby! It's okay for you, you can play the role of doting father if you want to, but I'm the one who has to carry it, has to worry about it, has to push it out of my body and then take care of it... It's like I've turned against myself!~
@6170 = ~And that makes it all the harder for me to deal with this! I have for so long convinced myself that this moment would be terrible, that you would blame me and accuse me of dreadful things. Instead you near enough break into song in your delight!~
@6171 = ~You really want this baby, don't you? You really, really do. Oh, <CHARNAME>, your enthusiasm for this only makes it all the more difficult for me, for I don't *want* a baby! It's okay for you, you can play the role of doting father if you want to, but I'm the one who has to carry it, has to worry about it, has to push it out of my body and then take care of it... It's like I've turned against myself!~
@6172 = ~Don't patronise me! Don't act as if you know the first thing about children, or... or how to deal with your pregnant girlfriend! You have no idea what this is doing to me, how dreadful I feel, especially now I know how much you welcome the news!~
@6173 = ~I'm not patronising you, Fade. I just remember how emotional the head scribes wife got when she had her first baby. She seemed so scared and always seemed to be crying at first, but then as her babe grew within her, she calmed down and then everything was okay. She really made a first rate mother, as I believe with all my heart that you will. I fear I will be the useless one, actually. I think it's only natural that you should feel this way.~
@6174 = ~(She shakes her head, hiccoughs and tries to dry her eyes on the edge of her tunic.) You really want this baby, don't you? You really, really do. Oh, <CHARNAME>, your enthusiasm for this only makes it all the more difficult for me, for I don't *want* a baby! It's okay for you, you can play the role of doting father if you want to, but I'm the one who has to carry it, has to worry about it, has to push it out of my body and then take care of it... It's like I've turned against myself!~
@6175 = ~Then what are we to do? Do we have a child neither of us wants, or do we live with the result of our foolishness?~
@6176 = ~I think it's obvious. We can't take care of a child, not now. I say get rid of it and get on with our lives.~
@6177 = ~Fade, I never meant to do this to you. You mustn't blame yourself. You should never have burdened yourself with all this. You should have realised I would support you in any decision you make. This is as much my fault as yours. And as much my problem.~
@6178 = ~(She sighs and places her hands upon her belly.) Well, little one, how does it feel to have such indecisive parents?~
@6179 = ~<CHARNAME>... In all honesty, I don't want this child, and yet I cannot bring myself to destroy it by myself. You say you will support me if I do bear this child of yours to term... and that scares me too.~
@6180 = ~I am yet again placing myself in your hands. I know you have never let me down before... please do not let me down this time. Please.~
@6181 = ~(She nods slowly and wraps her arms around your neck. Nestling her head upon your shoulder, she runs her fingers through your hair and sighs.)~
@6182 = ~This should have been the happiest moment in our lives, shouldn't it? <CHARNAME>, I am honoured that you feel me capable of having your baby, and I know that you will not abandon me, but I cannot help but feel I am yet again placing my destiny in your hands.~
@6183 = ~I know you have never let me down before... please do not let me down this time. Please.~
@6184 = ~Family? We are a... family?~
@6185 = ~(A small smile creeps across her lips, and she places her hands upon her belly.) Hear that, little one? You are to be born into a family. (whisper) One that I hope wants and cherishes you.~
@6186 = ~(Her smile deepens as she looks to you.) I fear you have already won your father over... hopefully you will be able to win your mother over too, given time.~
@6187 = ~You can't have me with no strings attached, <CHARNAME>. Your attitude to this... problem has made it clear to me that I am possibly not what I thought I was to you.~
@6188 = ~When I first brought this issue up, you did not seem so opposed. Maybe you told me those things just to keep me happy? I don't know. But I have to go now. Perhaps I will see you around sometime.~
@6189 = ~(She closes her eyes and nods, tears running down her cheeks.) Then it is settled. It is a shame it has come to this, but, in the cold light of day, perhaps it is for the best. We were obviously not meant to be after all. Maybe I will see you around sometime.~
@6190 = ~You see this as nothing more than an inconvenience, don't you? Do you think I can go through all this, only to have you reject it all as "not your problem" and then still carry on as usual? Well, you are sadly mistaken, <CHARNAME>! I... I cannot believe how callous you can be!~
@6191 = ~(She stands up and slaps you hard across your cheek.) That is for your lies!~
@6192 = ~(She lifts her boot and kicks you squarely in the groin.) And that is for you getting me in this predicament in the first place! I... I never want to see you again!~
@6193 = ~I hope you're right. (chuckle) Not about you being a useless father... I mean about the way I am feeling.~
@6194 = ~<CHARNAME>... my armour is getting tight. I think it needs to be let out a bit.~
@6195 = ~I did notice it--maybe there's someone somewhere who'll be able to do that for you. An armourer, perhaps?~
@6196 = ~(say nothing, just smile dotingly at her)~
@6197 = ~Are you sure? You're not far enough along to show yet... are you?~
@6198 = ~Either that or some kind of builder. Seems that every time I get dressed, it feels a bit tighter. I fear I won't be able to squeeze into this for much longer. I'm sure I shouldn't be showing like this yet...~
@6199 = ~Neither of us are experts, Fade. Maybe some women show sooner than others?~
@6200 = ~(grin) Maybe there's more than one little fella in there! Maybe that's why you seem to be getting big fast.~
@6201 = ~I'm sure it's all natural, my love. You're going to get a lot bigger than this!~
@6202 = ~Builder? Why a builder?~
@6203 = ~(sigh) Am I ever going to get any kind of sensible conversation out of you when we talk about this baby? I'm really beginning to feel quite uncomfortable!~
@6204 = ~I can't help it, my love! Each time I see you, all I can think of is how wonderful it is... that you've got our baby growing healthy and strong in you. Our baby...~
@6205 = ~I'm sorry... maybe there's someone somewhere who'll be able to do that for you. An armourer, perhaps?~
@6206 = ~Uncomfortable? Please, don't say that. I had hoped you were coming around to the idea of having this child!~
@6207 = ~I know--but I'm definitely beginning to put on weight. See? (She stands sideways and runs her hand over a small but definite bump.)~
@6208 = ~Well... you're definitely right. Maybe there's someone somewhere who'll be able to enlarge everything for you. An armourer, perhaps?~
@6209 = ~Possibly. I must admit, I haven't been around that many pregnant women. But it still worries me. You... you do remember that I was one of a twin, don't you?~
@6210 = ~Oh, yes, I remember. Sweetheart, let's not talk of your brother right now. He's long gone.~
@6211 = ~Hmmm. I do remember hearing somewhere that such things can run in families... maybe we should try to get it confirmed? Find out if the reason you're getting big fast is because there's indeed more than one little fella in there.~
@6212 = ~Twins?! Fade, I've just got used to the idea of us having *one* child, let alone two!~
@6213 = ~Well, I was one of a twin. Maybe... you never know.~
@6214 = ~Fade, I was joking.~
@6215 = ~(talk to her belly) So, maybe you're not alone in there, huh? (grin) Maybe I'm going to be a daddy twice over...~
@6216 = ~Hmfph. Don't remind me--I'm trying to forget that soon I will begin to resemble a whale of the beached variety. However... don't you find it odd? Surely this isn't right. Maybe I should go and see someone, just to see if everything is indeed okay?~
@6217 = ~If it will put your mind at ease, then we shall seek out advice. Although I am positive everything is going to be just fine.~
@6218 = ~If you want... (grin) Maybe there's more than one little fella in there! Maybe that's why you seem to be getting big fast.~
@6219 = ~Don't worry! Our baby is probably just growing big and strong, just like its mum and dad.~
@6220 = ~(laugh) So he can construct my armour around me! I fear I will soon be beyond the help of a mere tailor. Still... don't you find it odd? Surely this isn't right. Maybe I should go and see someone, just to see if everything is indeed okay?~
@6221 = ~Yes... our baby. Do you know how weird that still sounds to me? It's still all so surreal... and it's my body!~
@6222 = ~Maybe this is all natural, but I can't help but worry. Do you think I should go and see someone, just to see if everything is indeed okay?~
@6223 = ~I... I didn't mean it like that, <CHARNAME>. Yes, I'm still a bit anxious, but I was actually talking about being *physically* uncomfortable! This armour is quite constricting.~
@6224 = ~In that case, maybe we can find you someone who can enlarge everything for you. An armourer, perhaps?~
@6225 = ~Nothing wrong with constricting armour, Fade... (wink)~
@6226 = ~<CHARNAME>, it's okay, I wasn't thinking about Xek'ral at all. I was just... well... can't these things run in families? Twins, I mean. I've heard that if there's a precedent in the family, then such things can be more, you know, prevalent...~
@6227 = ~M-maybe that *would* be a good idea. It would be nice to know, and be able to stop all this uncertain worrying.~
@6228 = ~But do you think that there is going to be anyone willing to see me? Considering everything, they may see me as nothing more than a demon spawn, spawning more of the same!~
@6229 = ~Fade, what have I told you in the past? Stop the self-doubt! Why on earth would anyone begrudge helping you find out about the health of our child?~
@6230 = ~I seriously doubt anyone would even realise your ancestry, and even if they did, they'd have to deal with me as well. Don't worry, I won't allow anyone to insult you or our child... or, indeed, children.~
@6231 = ~Anything to stop you worrying, my dearest. We'll search out someone. Any clues where we should begin?~
@6232 = ~I... I know. But... What if that is the case? What will you do then?~
@6233 = ~One, two, even five... we'd cope! I mean, it would be a shock, but a nice one.~
@6234 = ~Oh, my love! I certainly didn't mean to add to your worries. I... I suppose I thought you may have been joking. You do so often tease me...~
@6235 = ~Maybe we should just try to find out first, and cross that bridge when we come to it, huh?~
@6236 = ~I know. But what if that is the case--that I am indeed carrying more than one child? What will you do then?~
@6237 = ~Absolutely nothing dampens your spirits, does it <CHARNAME>? Maybe that would be a good idea to try to get all this clarified in some way. It would be nice to know, and be able to stop all this uncertain worrying.~
@6238 = ~I hope so... I really do. Maybe that would be a good idea to try to get all this clarified in some way. It would be nice to know, and be able to stop all this uncertain worrying.~
@6239 = ~I dearly hope that is the case, <CHARNAME>, although I'm sure I shouldn't be showing quite so much quite so early on...~
@6240 = ~Why, <CHARNAME>! What a thing to say to the mother of your firstborn! Although I suspect you are referring to "figure-hugging" rather than "it doesn't bloody fit me any more!"... right?~
@6241 = ~Heh heh, that "figure-hugging" armour is one of the reasons you're in this state now, m'dear...~
@6242 = ~Not at all. I think you are blooming... you are as beautiful to me now as the day we met. Even *more* beautiful, if I may be so bold. You're willing to give me the one thing I can't physically give myself; a child, a legacy.~
@6243 = ~Maybe there's a reason you're out-growing it all so quickly... (grin) Maybe there's more than one little fella in there! Perhaps that's why you seem to be getting big fast.~
@6244 = ~No one, I hope. But... you never know. I doubt everyone we see will be as happy as you are about this situation. We'll see.~
@6245 = ~I'm sure there will be a local midwife somewhere, or at least a hedge-witch experienced in such things. Maybe one of the temples would be a good place to start? Let us go and see.~
@6246 = ~(She wraps her arms around your neck and nuzzles her head against your shoulder.) That is good to know, <CHARNAME>--and it makes me feel all the better.~
@6247 = ~I'm sure there will be someone somewhere who will agree to see us, a local midwife or something. Maybe one of the temples would be a good place to start? Let us go and see.~
@6248 = ~I'm not sure... surely there will be someone somewhere who will agree to see us, a local midwife or something. Maybe one of the temples would be a good place to start? Let us go and see.~
@6249 = ~So you say now... maybe it would be a good idea to try to get all this clarified in some way. It would be nice to know, so we stop all this uncertain worrying and have some time to prepare.~
@6250 = ~(chuckle) I guess the joke really is on me now, isn't it? I fear I'm being paid back for all those silly jests with the greatest of ironies! Still, it would be a good idea to try to get all this clarified in some way. It would be nice to know, and be able to stop all this uncertain worrying.~
@6251 = ~Maybe I should have worn a sack, hmm? Then perhaps none of this would have happened!~
@6252 = ~It would take a lot more than a sack to hide your beauty from me, my love.~
@6253 = ~Oooh, a sack... kinky!~
@6254 = ~Do you still regret this chain of events so much? Sometimes I kid myself that you say these things in jest, but I still can't help but feel you haven't accepted your fate as of yet.~
@6255 = ~(Fade looks up at you, her crimson eyes bright with emotion, and then rests her head upon your shoulder with a sigh.) Well, you certainly know how to make a girl feel loved! But... but what if something is wrong? Maybe this is all natural, but I can't help but worry.~
@6256 = ~Do you think I should go and see someone, just to see if everything is indeed okay?~
@6257 = ~Flatterer! But even so... Maybe it's a good idea to see someone. I'm sure I shouldn't be showing quite so much quite so early on...~
@6258 = ~Have a bit of a thing for the old burlap, do we? Like the way it itches? (grin) But even so... Maybe it's a good idea to see someone. I'm sure I shouldn't be showing quite so much quite so early on...~
@6259 = ~I wish I could just accept all this, but it feels so strange, so surreal... and it's my body! I keep trying to tell myself that this was meant to be, and that everything will be fine... but I still can't help but worry.~
@6260 = ~I seem to be getting bigger and bigger each and every morning! Do you think I should go and see someone, just to see if everything is indeed okay?~
@6261 = ~I was thinking, <CHARNAME>, maybe we should...~
@6262 = ~(All of a sudden, Fade stops and clutches at her belly, her crimson eyes wide.)~
@6263 = ~Fade? Fade!? Are you all right?~
@6264 = ~My love... what's the matter? Do you need to rest?~
@6265 = ~Uh... Fade?~
@6266 = ~(Seeing your alarm, Fade smiles and nods slowly as an incredulous look spreads across her face.) I'm... I'm fine, <CHARNAME>. The baby just moved... I felt it!~
@6267 = ~It... it moved? It... it really moved?~
@6268 = ~(Place your hand on her belly)~
@6269 = ~Are... are you sure? I mean, it wasn't just, you know, a bit of trapped wind or something?~
@6270 = ~(After a few moments, you do indeed feel some movement.)~
@6271 = ~I felt it too! I felt it! Oh, Fade...~
@6272 = ~(A slow and rather incredulous smile spreads across Fade's face.) No, I don't need to rest. It was the baby... the baby moved, <CHARNAME>! Our baby moved!~
@6273 = ~What? Are... are you sure? What did it feel like?~
@6274 = ~It moved? Already? (grin) That's my boy!~
@6275 = ~(Fade looks down at herself in astonishment, her hands still on her belly.) <CHARNAME>...~
@6276 = ~My love, are you all right? Is there something wrong with the baby?~
@6277 = ~Ummm... are you okay? You seem a bit... shocked!~
@6278 = ~Yes, it most definitely moved! Oh, that was weird... it was like it turned or something. I didn't think I'd be able to feel anything until I was much further along, but I definitely felt something!~
@6279 = ~(grin) Watch it, Fade... you look like you're happy to be having this child!~
@6280 = ~(place a hand on her belly) Can I see if I can feel it?~
@6281 = ~You're sure it was the child? Not something else?~
@6282 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... this makes it all so real... so... so...~
@6283 = ~(She falters, unable to express what she is feeling with mere words.)~
@6284 = ~I know, Fade, I know. This just confirms everything, doesn't it? That we are indeed going to be parents.~
@6285 = ~My love? Are... are you okay? Are you not delighted at this?~
@6286 = ~(grin) Watch it, Fade... you don't want your slightly grumpy façade to slip! You actually look like you're happy to be having this child.~
@6287 = ~<CHARNAME>, I think I know the difference between a bit of trapped wind and the movement of our firstborn child! Of course I'm sure!~
@6288 = ~Truly? Can I see if I can feel it too? (place your hand on her belly)~
@6289 = ~Really? You're that sure? What did it feel like?~
@6290 = ~You are? But... it's still very early... (grin) We've got a quick learner on our hands, here! That's my boy!~
@6291 = ~It felt... weird--it was like it turned or something. I didn't think I'd be able to feel anything until I was much further along, but I definitely felt something!~
@6292 = ~(laugh) That's your *boy*?? What happens if it's a girl? There's a fifty-fifty chance of that too, you know!~
@6293 = ~Sorry, Fade, just a figure of speech. You know I didn't mean anything by it! I'll love this child no matter what it is; a boy OR a girl!~
@6294 = ~(grin) Just teasing you, my dear! Of course I know it could equally be a girl. It just seems a bit weird and impersonal to be referring to it as, well... "It". Maybe we should give it some kind of nickname?~
@6295 = ~Oh, Fade, you know what I mean. I'm just so thrilled! Can I see if I can feel it too? (place your hand on her belly)~
@6296 = ~No... nothing is wrong... nothing is wrong at all! (A slow, incredulous look spreads across her face as she looks up at you.) It's just... the baby moved! I felt it!~
@6297 = ~(She looks up at you, her astonished look breaking into an incredulous smile.) I... I suppose I am a little bit shocked. It's the baby... the baby just moved. I felt it!~
@6298 = ~<CHARNAME>... I know I have been less that thrilled about my impending foray into motherhood, but there is no need to say something like that.~
@6299 = ~Dear, sweet Fade, I didn't say that to upset you, just to make you think. I know you are... less than happy about what is happening, but if you could only see your face--you looked absolutely delighted when the baby first moved... it near moved me to tears. Maybe... maybe you can now accept this child?~
@6300 = ~I'm sorry, I just couldn't help it! It's just that, for a moment, you looked like a mother-to-be should do... happy and excited. You... you don't have to feel bad, or like you're going to lose face if you admit to wanting this child, you know.~
@6301 = ~Come on, lighten up! I am just delighted that our baby is alive, well and fighting-fit. Can't you be too?~
@6302 = ~<CHARNAME>, of course I'm sure! It was unlike anything else I've ever felt before.~
@6303 = ~I know. I... I simply don't know what to say. I have so many fears and apprehensions, for you, myself and for the child... but the main difference is that before, I could almost still believe that all of this was a sun-dream; that I would wake up and none of this would be true.~
@6304 = ~But now... to feel that child move... it's solid confirmation that it *is* happening, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it!~
@6305 = ~(sigh) Darling, I'm sure all new mothers-to-be feel this way. It is only natural to be worried about whether we are going to do the right thing for our child. I know I am!~
@6306 = ~Fade... please, stop it! Why can't you just accept what is happening? One moment you seen delighted by it all, and then the next you are the epitome of negativity! I... I am finding it all very hard to cope with, I must admit.~
@6307 = ~What are you saying? That you... you wish there *was* something you could do to stop it?~
@6308 = ~Sometimes I am. Sometimes I actually feel excited--honoured, even--that I am having this child. So many good, deserving people in this world who want children can't have them, and so I feel... blessed, almost, that we can.~
@6309 = ~But then I start thinking about what a huge responsibility it all is, and how our child is going to have to overcome a lot more obstacles in life than most others. What right do we have to do that to someone? Our child will be a strange mix of demon, elf and divine blood, and that is such a huge burden to expect anyone to bear...~
@6310 = ~Honeykitten, this baby already has more than most children do when they are born! Yes, there are plenty of wanted children born, but there are even more unwanted ones. At least this child will have parents that will love and cherish it from the start, no matter what.~
@6311 = ~It is a huge burden, that I am not denying, but it is no bigger than either you or I had to bear. I am not in any way belittling your fears, but you should try to concentrate on the good feelings. This should be a joyous thing, after all!~
@6312 = ~Well, I am glad that you do at least sometimes feel happy about all of this, but you must try to keep things in perspective! As I have said over and over, I expect all new mothers-to-be feel this way. It is only natural to be worried about whether we are going to do the right thing for our child. I know I am!~
@6313 = ~But then I start thinking about what a huge responsibility it all is, and how our child is going to have to overcome a lot more obstacles in life than most others. What right do we have to do that to someone? Our child will be a strange mix of demon, elf, <PRO_RACE> and divine blood, and that is such a huge burden to expect anyone to bear...~
@6314 = ~I don't know. Men are always occupied with having sons, forgetting that their daughters could bring them just as much glory and delight... (grin)~
@6315 = ~I suppose it is a bit impersonal to be calling it, err, "It". How about... oh, I don't know... "Bump"? "Thingie"?~
@6316 = ~"Thingie"? That's worse than "It"! I think we should just go with "Bump"... after all, it's a good description!~
@6317 = ~Maybe we should take some time to think about this. Both of those are terrible nicknames!~
@6318 = ~Okay, maybe nicknames are not such a good idea. But it is good to see you having positive thoughts about our child, my love.~
@6319 = ~<CHARNAME>, what you ask... it is so huge! Sometimes I actually feel excited--honoured, even--that I am having this child. So many good, deserving people in this world who want children can't have them, and so I feel... blessed, almost, that we can.~
@6320 = ~(whisper) I know. I just need time to get to grips with this new... development. Oh, <CHARNAME>... this makes it all so real... so... so...~
@6321 = ~Can't you even allow yourself to be happy? Just... try it out. This shouldn't be this much of a trial for you. You should be as delighted as I am.~
@6322 = ~I... suppose I am, in my own way. The last thing I want is for anything bad to happen to the child, and I am happy that everything is progressing so well. But then doubt grips me, and... and... Oh, <CHARNAME>... this makes it all so real... so... so...~
@6323 = ~You have the same worries too? My love... I must admit, I never realised. I thought I was the only one worrying... that is why I have kept a lot of my doubts from you! I thought you would not approve of my negativity... I suppose I am still not used to completely sharing my feelings with another.~
@6324 = ~From now on, no more hiding. I promise I'll be more open with you, and that applies to the good things as well as the bad. That I promise you.~
@6325 = ~I do not need your promises, Fade, because I *know* you're going to be a fantastic mother. And I'll be here to support you all the way. I'm just happy knowing that you do indeed have positive thoughts about our child. I was beginning to worry that you would never accept it!~
@6326 = ~Just as long as you do... that is what I am here for! Sometimes I feel a bit superfluous. I want to help you, but don't know how. At least if you share your feelings with me, it will allow me to at least try to alleviate your fears.~
@6327 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I just can't help it! What you ask... it is so huge! Sometimes I actually feel excited--honoured, even--that I am having this child. So many good, deserving people in this world who want children can't have them, and so I feel... blessed, almost, that we can.~
@6328 = ~No! Now that it has happened, I would not stop this pregnancy now, even if I could. Had it been the result of anything other than our love then maybe, but it is not the child's fault we were irresponsible.~
@6329 = ~I will be all right. I just get a little overwhelmed by it all sometimes. Sometimes I actually feel excited--honoured, even--that I am having this child. So many good, deserving people in this world who want children can't have them, and so I feel... blessed, almost, that we can.~
@6330 = ~(chuckle) Yet again, you manage to make my fears seem so very irrational. <CHARNAME>, what would I do without you? No, don't answer that... I don't want to know.~
@6331 = ~You are going to be a fantastic father. You have no idea how many times I count my lucky stars that I have you!~
@6332 = ~And you are going to be a fantastic mother! Once the baby is born, just you watch. You'll be despairing of me, that I am sure. You know the reputation of new fathers...~
@6333 = ~You don't have to thank anything, Fade. I should be the one thanking you, for giving me this gift. And I don't just mean the child--I mean you, too.~
@6334 = ~I realise this... and I promise I will try harder to concentrate on the good feelings rather than the bad ones.~
@6335 = ~(Fade looks down at herself. Although she is no where near as swollen as she will be in the future, she definitely has a slight bump.) I suppose it is! Bump... our bump...~
@6336 = ~(laugh) Maybe you're right. If only there was a way of telling what sex the baby is! Then at least we could pick a name.~
@6337 = ~I... I am trying, <CHARNAME>. Sometimes I actually feel excited--honoured, even--that I am having this child. So many good, deserving people in this world who want children can't have them, and so I feel... blessed, almost, that we can.~
@6338 = ~What did I do to deserve you, huh? Nothing in this life, that is for sure. Maybe I was some kind of Paladin in a past one. You're just too good to me!~
@6339 = ~(She looks down at her growing bump. To your your relief, her expression is one of profound fondness.) Maybe this isn't such a bad thing after all... maybe we can make this work.~
@6340 = ~I didn't realise that you would feel that way... I never meant to make you feel bad! My promise stands, then. In the future, I will let you know of all my doubts... and my hopes.~
@6341 = ~Don't say that! You're going to be the one I'm going to rely on the most.~
@6342 = ~Well, you and maybe Imoen!~
@6343 = ~(She blushes, and looks at you almost shyly.) You don't mean that, <CHARNAME>. I'm the one with the most to be thankful for! I often wonder exactly what I did to deserve you--nothing in this life, that's for sure!~
@6344 = ~And to think our meeting was a chance thing, that you could have refused my offer... I'm so very glad you didn't, you know. If it wasn't for you...~
@6345 = ~(With a smile, Fade takes your hand and kisses your cheek.) How are you feeling today, <CHARNAME>?~
@6346 = ~(laugh) Well, what has brought this about?~
@6347 = ~I'm absolutely fine. And yourself?~
@6348 = ~I'm not too bad... although you seem quite chirpy.~
@6349 = ~If I'm honest... bloody dreadful. (smile) But seeing you happy always helps.~
@6350 = ~(grin) Do I have to have a reason?~
@6351 = ~No, of course not! It's nice to see you looking so chirpy.~
@6352 = ~(grin) Now I'm worried. What do you want?~
@6353 = ~Well, I'm feeling dreadful, so if you want to be unnecessarily happy, go and do it at someone else.~
@6354 = ~I'm very good! I, err, want to tell you something, actually.~
@6355 = ~Well, come on! You don't have to hold back now. What is it?~
@6356 = ~Not more surprises, Fade. I don't think I can cope with anymore of your surprises, not after the last one!~
@6357 = ~You don't have to ask, you know. You can just tell me things!~
@6358 = ~Chirpy?! Now that's not a word I thought I would ever hear in conjunction with myself, that's for sure, but I suppose I have a reason to feel good. I have something to tell you.~
@6359 = ~Thank you! But why do you feel so bad?~
@6360 = ~Oh, no reason... just all of this is kind of getting me down now. Everything that is happening around me is so serious. If I didn't have you, I don't know what I'd do.~
@6361 = ~Oh, it's nothing for you to be concerned over, Fade. So, are you going to tell me why you're in such a good mood or not?~
@6362 = ~I just do. Fancy cheering me up?~
@6363 = ~I don't want anything! Well... okay, so I want to tell you something, but it's nothing bad, I promise!~
@6364 = ~Now what's wrong with you, Mr. Grumpy? I just wanted to share something nice with you, that's all. Is that so bad?~
@6365 = ~Yes, it is. Go away.~
@6366 = ~No, I suppose not. Heaven knows, I could do with hearing something nice... what is it?~
@6367 = ~Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't take it out on you. What is it?~
@6368 = ~I just wanted you to know that since I... I felt the baby move, I've been thinking about what you said to me. And since I promised I wouldn't hold anything back anymore... I'm sorry I have put you through all of this--all my doubt over this child, about how we would cope with it and everything.~
@6369 = ~But some good has come out of all of it. I feel I have finally accepted it. I thought long and hard last night, about how I would feel if I wasn't having the baby, how much closer it has brought us and how I would feel if I... I lost it.~
@6370 = ~That is indeed wonderful news! Oh, Fade, I knew you'd come round eventually. Now we can look forward to the birth of our baby together, without anything hanging over us!~
@6371 = ~And... how did you feel? When you asked yourself these questions?~
@6372 = ~You have no idea how happy that makes me feel, Fade. I was worried for a while that I had almost forced you into this against your will.~
@6373 = ~Thank you for having the courage to admit such a thing to me. After so much doubt, I am delighted you have now realised your true feelings!~
@6374 = ~Never fear--this is nothing quite like that! (grin) Although I can't think of anything else that could surprise you quite as much as junior here did.~
@6375 = ~I know, but old habits do die hard, as they say! I simply wanted you to know that since I... I felt the baby move, I've been thinking about what you said to me. And since I promised I wouldn't hold anything back anymore... I'm sorry I have put you through all of this--all my doubt over this child, about how we would cope with it and everything.~
@6376 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, you are so sweet. Melodramatic, but sweet! I hope what I have to tell you will cheer you up.~
@6377 = ~Well... I just wanted you to know that since I... I felt the baby move, I've been thinking about what you said to me. And since I promised I wouldn't hold anything back anymore... I'm sorry I have put you through all of this--all my doubt over this child, about how we would cope with it and everything.~
@6378 = ~I hope I can--I hope what I have to tell you will do the job nicely.~
@6379 = ~<CHARNAME>! Don't be so bloody melodramatic! I just wanted to tell you that I have finally resigned myself into having this child of yours, but Gods help me, if it turns out to be anything like you when you are in one of these moods, I'll damn well drown it!~
@6380 = ~Fade... you wouldn't?! That's an awful thing to say!~
@6381 = ~Oh, ha ha. You wouldn't harm a hair on that babe's head. As much as you have protested in the past, you already love it too much! And me. You love me too much too!~
@6382 = ~(grin) Well, okay, that's something to drag me out of my melancholy--good news AND a dire threat!~
@6383 = ~Heh, don't worry. It's it's not as if I don't take these things out on you!~
@6384 = ~(smile) I had hoped this would be your reaction--I just thought you ought to know. I know I've been a right old miserable bitch through all of this, and I regret it whole-heartedly.~
@6385 = ~Last night, I began to wonder how our child feel if it found out its mother didn't love it, and I found myself getting upset and swearing that no matter what, I would not let that happen. Then it hit me--just because my mother didn't love me, doesn't mean I can't love our son or daughter, that only I could break that cycle and prove that, Fey'ri or not, I can and will be a good mother!~
@6386 = ~My main fear was that I would have to go it alone... but your constant reassurances have made me realise my fears were groundless. Yes, I am still worried about the birth and everything, but I think that's just natural.~
@6387 = ~At last, I truly feel free from my own selfishness. And I have you to thank for that. I say with no shame that I love this child with all my heart... just as I love you. I just wanted you to know this.~
@6388 = ~When I asked myself how I would feel if I lost the baby, I got upset... very upset. I never realised just how attached I am to it now, deep down. I also realised that unconsciously, I have been protecting it since the beginning. I have been more cautious is battle, not just because you asked me to be, but because I truly did not want anything to hurt my baby.~
@6389 = ~For some time now, my doubts have seemed more and more selfish... more and more pathetic. This acceptance--not just of the physical presence of the child, but of how I feel towards it--has lifted a great burden from my shoulders.~
@6390 = ~I say with no shame that I love this child with all my heart... just as I love you. I just wanted you to know this.~
@6391 = ~No... you never did that. I will not lie to you--I did consider just getting rid of the child and never telling you, but I knew I could not live with myself I had done that. I could not be untruthful to you about something like this, as it would only hurt you, and I would never have been able to forgive myself for that.~
@6392 = ~Yes, I have resented this child--I saw it as a burden, a physical hindrance to what I wanted to do and what I wanted to be! For all my rather random and haphazard ways, I do like absolute control over myself. I fear I even resented you for a while, for getting me into this predicament in the first place!~
@6393 = ~But last night... last night I thought long and hard about this, and I realised that all my doubts and fears were only selfish, and then when I further probed myself with questions about how I would feel if I lost our child, I got upset... very upset. Then it struck me how much energy I was putting into keeping a barrier up between the baby and myself... so I took the barrier down.~
@6394 = ~And do you know what I found? What I had to admit to myself, after all this time of vehement denial? I adore it. I love this child, with all my heart... just as I love you. I just wanted you to know this.~
@6395 = ~<CHARNAME>, it takes me no courage now to tell you this. I fear I have been somewhat selfish and needlessly maudlin over this whole situation.~
@6396 = ~It pains me to say this, but I... I have been deliberately putting a barrier between myself and this baby. I was so... angry at not having control over my body, I decided that nothing good could come from this pregnancy. I fear I even resented you for a while for getting me into this predicament in the first place!~
@6397 = ~But since we last spoke, since I felt our baby move within me, knowing that, although it grows strong, I am the only one who can truly protect it... I realised that I never want anything to harm it, that there is nothing I wouldn't do to protect our child.~
@6398 = ~This acceptance--not just of the physical presence of the child, but of how I feel towards it--has lifted a great burden from my shoulders. I say with no shame that I love this child with all my heart... just as I love you. I just wanted you to know this.~
@6399 = ~Oh, I was joking and you know it! I'm trying to tell you something important here!~
@6400 = ~(Fade swats you playfully.) Smug bastard! Remind me to be meaner to you in the future.~
@6401 = ~But you're right. I just wanted you to know that since I... I felt the baby move, I've been thinking about what you said to me. And since I promised I wouldn't hold anything back anymore... I'm sorry I have put you through all of this--all my doubt over this child, about how we would cope with it and everything.~
@6402 = ~(laugh) Dire threats... they work nine times out of ten!~
@6403 = ~I am glad you see this as good news, though. I just wanted you to know that since I... I felt the baby move, I've been thinking about what you said to me. And since I promised I wouldn't hold anything back anymore... I'm sorry I have put you through all of this--all my doubt over this child, about how we would cope with it and everything.~
@6404 = ~Hey, you two! Why have you stopped? Is Fade okay?~
@6405 = ~I'm... I'm fine, Imoen! It's the baby... the baby moved!~
@6406 = ~The baby... it moved? My little nephew or niece? Oh, that's just so adorable! Can... can I feel too? So I can, you know, say "hello" and all...~
@6407 = ~(laugh) Of course you can, Auntie-to-be! (grin) If Daddy will let you, of course.~
@6408 = ~(grin) Of course Daddy will let Auntie Imoen say "hello"! She's going to be a huge part of baby's life, or so I hope.~
@6409 = ~In a moment, Imoen... Again! It moved again! (kneel down and rest your cheek on Fade's belly)~
@6410 = ~Do you two really think you're going to have much of a choice? Of course I'm going to be part of the baby's life!~
@6411 = ~(With a delighted chuckle, Imoen places a hand on Fade's belly.) Nope, nothing yet. Come on, little one, say hello to your Auntie Imoen...~
@6412 = ~(grin) Looks like junior is only going to perform for mummy and daddy toda-- OH!!~
@6413 = ~I felt it too! It was only slight, but it was definitely there!~
@6414 = ~(grin) Well, I for one hope it settles down soon, otherwise I'm not going to be able to concentrate on anything else!~
@6415 = ~I think that's my cue to leave... (wink)~
@6416 = ~Oh, no fair! I want to dote on the baby too!~
@6417 = ~<CHARNAME>! You've got to share with your sister. Let Imoen introduce herself to the baby.~
@6418 = ~(grin) Thank you, Fade. Come on, <CHARNAME>... listen to mommy-to-be.~
@6419 = ~Oh, all right! Bloody women, bullying me all the time... (grin)~
@6420 = ~Okay, I'll let Auntie Imoen say "hello", since I know I'll catch Hell from mummy if I don't. Still, she's going to be a huge part of your life, or so I hope, so you'd better be introduced sooner rather than later.~
@6421 = ~(grin) Damn right!~
@6422 = ~If it wasn't for us women, you men would be in a right pickle!~
@6423 = ~(laugh) I couldn't agree more. Where would you be if you didn't have Imoen and me to sort things out for you?~
@6424 = ~Precisely! (grin) And if you think you're going to get away with raising this baby on your own, you're sadly mistaken. Do really think I'm going to stand there and let you two go it alone? Of course I'm going to be part of the baby's life!~
@6425 = ~F-Fade, may I ask you something?~
@6426 = ~*Sigh* Aerie, if is this going to be about your lost wings or omniscient *Uncle Quayle* again, then I'm not really--~
@6427 = ~W-what?... No!  It's not about that at all.~
@6428 = ~It's just that... back in Athkatla, you said we have a lot in common.  I didn't know what you meant by it back then, but when I found out you'd been kept prisoner like I was--~
@6429 = ~What do you mean, that I was kept prisoner?~
@6430 = ~You know... that man you've mentioned once or twice... Pasha Dominguez, if I recall his name correctly.~
@6431 = ~(softly) That's his name, yes. I don't want to talk about it, Aerie.  I don't want to talk about *him*.   I've worked far too hard and far too long trying to forget.  Just drop it, all right?~
@6432 = ~I-I'm so sorry Fade, I didn't mean to... I only asked because... I can't get my captor out of my head... not entirely at least.~
@6433 = ~I wish I could forget, just like you, Fade.  You're lucky.~
@6434 = ~No, Aerie, I'm not. And I never said I *had* forgotten.  But that doesn't mean I'm not still trying.~
@6435 = ~My, my, my!  What have we here?  The slave-girl and the circus freak throwing a pity-party?  How precious!~
@6436 = ~Shut up, bitch, nobody invited you.~
@6437 = ~(smiles wickedly) Ahh, such fire! No wonder your pasha was so fond of you.  It must have been most enjoyable for him to stoke your infernal temper before using you for his pleasure.  Tell me, Fade, did he chain you to the bedposts and--~
@6438 = ~How *dare* you...!~
@6439 = ~(laughs) You know nothing of pain and misery, ibilith! Your pathetic *suffering* would be considered a coddled life among my people. ~
@6440 = ~At least you have proven yourself somewhat useful to our company on occasion, despite your inferiority...  Which is far more than I can say for the xa'huuli rumn we carry around with us like so much baggage.  Perhaps we should just toss her into a river and put an end to her misery... and ours.~
@6441 = ~W-what? Oh, you... you...  (sob) I *hate* you!~
@6442 = ~(shakes her head) You really *are* a bitch, Viconia.~
@6443 = ~Thank you, iblith.  I try.~
@6444 = ~F-Fade...I'm sorry.~
@6445 = ~Hmm? Did you say something, Aerie?~
@6446 = ~I said I'm sorry. Last time we... talked... You said you were trying to forget what had happened to you. I want to do that, too... learn to forget.  But maybe I'm different.  Maybe people like you just find it easier...~
@6447 = ~People like *me*?  I'm not sure what you mean, Aerie.~
@6448 = ~People who are tough... and strong... like you.~
@6449 = ~We're in the same boat, you and I. There's no difference between what happened to you and what happened to me.  We both got hurt, we both went through hell, and you know what?  We both survived. Maybe you're a lot stronger than you think.~
@6450 = ~You may be right.~
@6451 = ~While traveling with <CHARNAME> I've seen so many others who have lost so much... their homes, the people they love. I guess we're not so different from them.~
@6452 = ~No, we're not. There are others in this world who have suffered great loss and somehow manage to keep going . We're no better, no worse.  One foot in front of the other, Aerie.  It all works out in the end.~
@6453 = ~(Aerie shivers) Is-is it getting...cold? Brr!  I suppose we should move on before it get's even... colder.~
@6454 = ~I must admit, naut kleel uss, your tenacity is rather surprising to me. Many others of your ilk might have died a thousand times by now, or at the very least have given up, but not you. Somehow you have managed to...persevere.~
@6455 = ~Are you sure you meant to say *surprising*? Or is *disappointing* the word you really had in mind?~
@6456 = ~(sighs irritably) I come to you with a peace offering, and you respond with recalcitrance!  I should have expected no less from a jaed wael such as you.  I simply meant to say that you have managed to prove that even a common vith rothe can do more than scrubbing fungus from a wall or licking the sweat off your master's backside.  It seems there is more to you than meets the eye. I could almost learn to like you.~
@6457 = ~A peace offering that's coated in the same toxic bile that fills your soul, drow scum!  You've crossed the line one too many times, Viconia.  My past is *my* business, and if I were you I'd think twice before bringing it up again.  Otherwise, you may accidentally lose a foot in some nasty trap that I just *might* fail to notice.~
@6458 = ~Is that supposed to be a threat? Dear little Fade, surely you can do better than that.~
@6459 = ~One more word, Viconia, and I swear I'll scrape that smug look off your face with a spoon.~
@6460 = ~Ah, that's much better! Fine, then. I shall leave you be, creature, but only because I tire of your presence.~
@6461 = ~Ugh! The stench of sulfur in this place is positively cloying.  I can feel it seeping into my skin with every moment we spend here!  (Sweetly) But you, Fade... you must feel right at home in a place like this, hmm?~
@6462 = ~There are only so many times I will allow you to insult me, Viconia, and you are very quickly reaching the limit.~
@6463 = ~Oh, is that so, lotha errdegahr? And what shall happen then? More *trap threats*? A knife in the back? Or are you going to be creative and slip a viper in my bedroll?~
@6464 = ~Hmm.  So very tempting.  Thanks for the ideas.~
@6465 = ~You really are a fool, Fade.  There is no instrument of death or pain your pathetic little imagination can conjure up that the drow have not already perfected.  I would be happy to show you exactly what I am capable of, lotha wael.~
@6466 = ~I won't give you the satisfaction, Viconia. Go to hell.~
@6467 = ~Oh, but look! We're already here, aren't we?~
@6468 = ~It seems there shall be no end to our trials and travails, at least, not in the near future. Surrounded by war and hunted like rats...Alas, but we are a cursed lot indeed.~
@6469 = ~Why, Anomen, I never figured you to be the (*cough*) whining type (giggle).~
@6470 = ~Oh, be silent, demon!  Your continued presence amongst us only serves to amplify the misery of our circumstances.~
@6471 = ~(still grinning) Awww, Anomen, that's sweet!  You really know how to make a girl feel important.~
@6472 = ~Important?  Pah!  As important and welcome as these...(swat!)...accursed Tethyrian desert sand flies!~
@6473 = ~I agree.... these sand flies definitely *are* annoying.~
@6474 = ~(Fade suddenly reaches out and smacks Anomen soundly on the back of the neck, smiling evilly at the resounding yelp he emits.)~
@6475 = ~*WHAT* in the Nine Hells--?!~
@6476 = ~Sand fly.  On your neck.  Gone now.  (wide grin).~
@6477 = ~BAH!  Away with you, foul creature!~
@6478 = ~Here, Anomen.  I made this for you.~
@6479 = ~You...did?  Er...this is rather unexpected.~
@6480 = ~(Anomen takes the folded square of mesh that Fade proffers and looks at it perplexedly). What *is* it?~
@6481 = ~I used the finest thread I could get my hands on.  When I was training with the Shadow Thieves, I picked up this trick of making these tiny little knots -- so small you can barely tell they're there -- and weaving together a very fine mesh that's very light and almost invisible.  (Fade shrugs) It's very useful in a variety of situations.  I just never really needed to use it until now.~
@6482 = ~I'm afraid I...don't understand...~
@6483 = ~Well, you complain constantly about the sand flies, so I figured I'd help you solve that problem.  Here --- allow me.  (Fade takes the square of mesh from a still bewildered Anomen and fully unfolds it to reveal a decidedly bag-like shape, complete with a very fine drawstring around the opening.  She deftly slips the bag over Anomen's head and tugs gently at the drawstring, tying it loosely around the base of his neck.)~
@6484 = ~I...feel ridiculous.~
@6485 = ~But you won't have sand flies buzzing around your face and neck all day long.~
@6486 = ~I...suppose not.  (*cough*)  Thank you...Fade.~
@6487 = ~(Fade grins widely at Anomen and winks) Of course!  After all, what are friends for?~
@6488 = ~(She turns to walk away, and you're pretty sure that the look on her face is one of fiendish mischief and smug self-satisfaction.)~
@6489 = ~The seasons turn and each day follows the next, yet it seems we are no closer to the end of our struggle than the day we began.~
@6490 = ~You sound tired, Cernd. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?~
@6491 = ~If only it were as simple as a few kind words to chase away the gathering darkness.  Thank you, my friend, for your offer but I'm afraid it will take far more than kind words to soothe the unease that grows within me. As the leaves are tossed about by a tempest wind, so is my spirit buffeted by the gale that follows in <CHARNAME>'s wake.~
@6492 = ~That sounds terribly ominous.  Are you sure there's nothing I can do?  I'm a really good listener, if that counts.~
@6493 = ~(smile) And so you are.~
@6494 = ~(sigh) Perhaps I am simply growing too old for this life of endless turmoil and conflict.  I find myself more and more missing the peaceful serenity afforded by my grove, and I must fight with every fiber of my being against the urge to simply turn and flee from this endless chaos.~
@6495 = ~I know what you mean. Sometimes it's a struggle just to get out of bed, knowing that today is going to be just as crazy as yesterday, and the day before.~
@6496 = ~(laughing gently) Truer words were never spoken, but I had thought you rather predisposed to this kind of life. ~
@6497 = ~Well, most of the time, maybe.  But I wouldn't mind a vacation now and then, you know?~
@6498 = ~Well then, perhaps when this is all over you will come and visit Ahsdale and I in our grove, and we will show you the joys of peace and quiet and homemade berry preserves.~
@6499 = ~Hells, yes!  I'm *so* there!~
@6500 = ~It seems <CHARNAME> is far more attached to <PROHISHER> demon familiar than I first thought.~
@6501 = ~I am truly (and quite uncharacteristically) confounded as to why <CHARNAME> insists on keeping you around. Despite my vastly superior powers of observation and keen eye for worth, I fail to see how your continuous presence in this group increases our collective viability. (There.  Let her muddle through those big words for a while! Perhaps the strain of trying to unfathom the meaning of my words will cause her brain to explode and cease her insufferable existence once and for all.) ~
@6502 = ~Err...what?~
@6503 = ~Exactly.~
@6504 = ~Well, for your information, Edwin, I actually *do* contribute a lot to this group.  Who do you think pushed you out of the way when that exploding barrel trap went off?~
@6505 = ~And you pushed me right into a pile of loose rocks, you incompetent amateurish insipid imbecile! (Not to mention it caused me to scrape my knee and ruin one of my best robes!)~
@6506 = ~I saved your life, you ungrateul git.~
@6507 = ~You did nothing of the sort.  I was perfectly aware that the barrel trap was there, and I was preparing to cast a Globe of Invunerability spell on myself in order to allow the trap to explode upon my very person, thus saving the entire party with my extraordinary bravery and heroism.  (Yes, even *she* must admit what an undeniably impressive feat that would have been.)~
@6508 = ~(Fade rolls her eyes and sighs)  You're completely delusional, Edwin, but... whatever.~
@6509 = ~Fade, do indulge this meddlesome sparrow's curiosity if you would, for I have oft wondered if you have ever been gripped by the inclination to seek your origins beyond the Prime.~
@6510 = ~No, I can't say that I have.  I'm not from another plane, Haer'dalis, you know that.~
@6511 = ~Aye, I am aware that despite your fey progenitor you are -- for all intents and purposes -- a Prime. You do, however, carry the blood of a planar creature in your veins, and it does surprise me to hear you say that your blood has never once called to you to unravel the mysteries of your heritage.~
@6512 = ~Well, I wouldn't say it *never* has, but I really don't see a point to pursuing such a useless endeavor.  I mean, what good would it do?~
@6513 = ~Useless?  Ahh, but my little firefinch I beg to disagree!  Pursuits of knowledge are never useless, in this humble sparrow's opinion.  One can only better oneself through gaining more understanding of that which surrounds you, comprises you, and *is* you. ~
@6514 = ~(smile) You really have a way with words, my friend.  You make even the dullest things sound so romantic.~
@6515 = ~(Haer'dalis bows theatrically and laughs) Ah, my dear, you do flatter this poor bard with your blandishments.  I do urge you, however, to think on it, and should the urge compel you to seek your past, then I shall be more than happy to play the part of tour guide should your search take you to my fair Sigil.~
@6516 = ~(Fade smiles genuinely) I'll keep that in mind.  Thank you, Haer'dalis.~
@6517 = ~Haer'dalis, will you tell me more about Sigil?  I have to admit that our last conversation actually did pique my interest some.~
@6518 = ~Most certainly, for it is a subject near and dear to mine own heart! It is a place frought with wonders both beautiful and deadly, not very unlike yourself. You would certainly fit in quite well with the native population.~
@6519 = ~Flatterer (she smiles, swatting playfully at his sleeve).  But seriously, you talk about it quite a lot.  It must be amazing.~
@6520 = ~*Amazing* does not even begin to describe what awaits you in the City of Doors!  Shall I tell you of the Market and Guildhall Wards, where all manner of goods are bought and sold, where anything your heart could *possibly* desire is there for the taking -- for the right price, of course.  Or shall I tell you about the Lady's Ward, where the rich and beautiful flock to parade about in all their grandeur, to set the night alight with their wild carousing...  (sigh) Ah, once again the pangs of homesickness pluck away at my heartstrings.~
@6521 = ~Are most of the people in Sigil tieflings like you?~
@6522 = ~(laughs heartily) Oho! Most certainly they are not. While tieflings are indeed plentiful in Sigil, we are far outnumbered by the denizens of countless other planes, and that in itself does lend itself to a limitelss variety of shapes, colors, sizes, textures, tastes and temperaments.  You will certainly not want for subjects with which to sate your curiosity, if that indeed is your wont.~
@6523 = ~I've also hear you refer to Sigil as *The Cage*.  Why is that?~
@6524 = ~Ah, yes.  Well, you see...Sigil can only be accessed through a multitude of portals, which lead to and fro across the planar realms.  As such, one would need a portal key to enter and exit the city, and those who find themselves without find themselves either locked out of the city, or trapped within, depending of course, on which side you wish to be on.~
@6525 = ~(Fade shudders involuntarily at the thought.)  I don't know if I like the idea of being *trapped* anywhere, Haer'dalis.  I think maybe...maybe it's better that I leave the planewalking to someone else.  But thank you for the offer.~
@6526 = ~Um, Imoen?  Here's your nail file back.  I broke a nail during our last fight, but you were kinda busy, so I...borrowed it.~
@6527 = ~Hey! You should have asked first! But...I suppose I should have asked you if I could borrow your string. I couldn't find my laces earlier, and...well, I hope you don't mind.~
@6528 = ~(raising her eyebrow) So *you* took my string! I was going crazy trying to find it this morning.  Oh, and here's the extra lace I borrowed..~
@6529 = ~I've been looking for it all morning, Fade!~
@6530 = ~Oh, really?  I'm sorry.  You can have it back now.~
@6531 = ~Yes, really. Do it again and I won't give you back your skeleton key, Fade.~
@6532 = ~(grin) I must admit I'm quite impressed, Imoen. I thought this whole spellcasting thing got you all rusty.~
@6533 = ~You know what they say: once you learn to swim...~
@6534 = ~Yes, I know. But I'd rather say: once you learn how to pick one's pocket...~
@6535 = ~...you'll never stop? (smiles)~
@6536 = ~Fade, a moment, if you will.~
@6537 = ~Yes, Jaheira?~
@6538 = ~I know that our friendship has been somewhat strained, at best, but for the sake of the group I feel it is time to put such adversarial feelings aside and focus on the task at hand.~
@6539 = ~Friendship?  Jaheira, you don't even like me.  At least, that's the impression you've given me.~
@6540 = ~Yes, well... (ahem) I am not one for overt displays of affection--~
@6541 = ~Hah!  Yeah... You don't exacly give people the warm and fuzzies--~
@6542 = ~(impatiently) Fade!  This is... not easy for me, so *please* allow me to finish.~
@6543 = ~--~
@6544 = ~As I was saying, it is time to put any adversarial feelings we might have for each other aside and focus on helping <CHARNAME> reach <PROHISHER> goal. Can we agree on this?~
@6545 = ~(A slow smile spreads across Fade's features, then she impulsively grabs Jaheira into a crushing bear-hug.)~
@6546 = ~Ooof! Uh, yes.  Well, then.  That settles it.~
@6547 = ~Jaheira? Could you... um... could you take a look at this and see if there's anything--.~
@6548 = ~(Fade sidles up to Jaheira and slowly peels back her sleeve to display an angry-looking gash that runs the length of her forearm).  It's... it's been throbbing lately...~
@6549 = ~Well, no wonder!  It has begun to fester, Fade.  However did you manage to injure yourself so gravely?  No matter.  It must be cleaned and wrapped with a poultice to draw out the infection.~
@6550 = ~(With this declaration Jaheira sets down her pack and spends a few minutes rifling through it until she finds what she is looking for:  a roll of fresh, clean bandages and a small bundle of tightly compressed, somewhat gray-looking leaves which she begins to crumble between her fingers.  She moistens the leaves with a few drops from her water-skin and applies a generous layer to the angry, red skin around Fade's wound before wrapping the entire forearm in bandages, from elbow to wrist.  Fade meekly submits to Jaheira's not-so-gentle ministrations, occasionally punctuating her silence with a sharp intake of breath or a small whimper of pain. When Jaheira is finished, she carefully inspects her handiwork, flexing Fade's wrist and each of her fingers to ensure her mobility is uncompromised. Satisfied, Jaheira nods curtly and picks up her pack).~
@6551 = ~It will heal, in time.  But you must keep it clean and re-apply the poultice each time you change your bandages. ~
@6552 = ~Thank you, Jaheira.  It feels better already.~
@6553 = ~(Jaheira scoffs, but there is an unmistakably gratified look in her eyes.) Nonsense.  As I said, it will take time.  But... you are most welcome.~
@6554 = ~Fade, I have... I have been thinking about that conversation we had recently.  It pains me to know that you were under the impression that I did not like you.~
@6555 = ~Well... you never really gave me any reason to think otherwise.~
@6556 = ~(sigh) I have never been one for conspicuous displays of affection, and many have said that my manner is unnecessarily gruff. Truth be told, Fade, I have come to respect you as both an agreeable traveling companion, and a valued member of this group.  Time and again we have battled and vanquished powerful foes and all the while you have stood by <CHARNAME> and this company and fought valiantly by our side; you have saved my life in battle on more than one occassion and for this you have my gratitude and... my friendship. ~
@6557 = ~Thank...thank you, Jaheira.  That's probably the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.~
@6558 = ~If there is one thing I have learned while traveling in <CHARNAME>'s company it is this: the world has seen more than its share of cruelty and indifference. Khalid and I once set out to make a difference, to right what wrongs we could and affect change for the better.  But for change to come, it must start somewhere, and what better place than from within?  Come, we have lagged behind and should catch up with the others.~
@6559 = ~Hey, Jan...is this that doohickey you invented that can detect and disarm traps from several paces away?  That's pretty nifty!~
@6560 = ~Oh, you mean my Infravision-Enabled Self-Powered Automated Remote-Controlled Hazard Neutralizer?~
@6561 = ~Uh...Yeah.~
@6562 = ~Actually, as the name infers, it also comes with an infravision module that allows you to use it in near-perfect darkness, as well as a self-contained perpetual power source which infinitely recharges itself; so essentially, the more you use it, the more power it makes.  Now, now, no need for befuddlement;  it's really quite simple.  Think of it as...a prairie dog in a plantation.  The more vegetables the prairie dog eats, the more...er, maybe that wasn't the best way to explain it, but...hmmm, I wonder if I can boost the power output by upgrading the core to synthesize data using binary integers instead of-- ~
@6563 = ~Okay, okay!  Can you show me how to use it?~
@6564 = ~Certainly! It really is a lot simpler than it looks.  I actually managed to teach my Uncle Gerhard's mother-in-law's brother how to use it, and that's something of a feat considering he's always been a few turnips short of a bushel--~
@6565 = ~Jan--~
@6566 = ~All right, all right!  No need to get testy!  This here is the power switch...you know, to turn it on...~
@6567 = ~Uh-huh...~
@6568 = ~This is the multidirectional scanner, which collects data and feeds it into processor, which is regulated by this the primary modulator  powered by three separate capacitors connected by thermally insulated dielectric wires, which incidentally were originally invented by my late cousin's third husband...~
@6569 = ~Oh, gods...~
@6570 = ~...the involution on the main coil actually speeds up the data collation process, although some people -- like my third-cousin Theodore's wife's great-uncle's fourth-cousin thrice-removed -- have argued that it has nothing to do with it, but I don't necessarily agree with that theory.  My inference is that...~
@6571 = ~You know what, Jan?  I think maybe I'll stick to doing things the old-fashioned way.  Thanks anyway.~
@6572 = ~But I haven't even told you about the hidden feature yet!~
@6573 = ~Hidden feature, eh?  What else can it do?~
@6574 = ~It can spot a turnip from 500 paces away, in the dark!~
@6575 = ~I'm going to walk away now.~
@6576 = ~Fade, let us speak for a moment, if you will.~
@6577 = ~Sure, Keldorn, what's on your mind?~
@6578 = ~Do you intend to return to Athkatla when our journey with <CHARNAME> is done?~
@6579 = ~I guess so.  I mean, I don't really have anywhere else *to* go.  Why do you ask?~
@6580 = ~Because, my friend, of your affiliation with the Shadowmaster.  If you return to his employ, then you and I will surely come into conflict one way or another, for my Order has sworn to do everything possible to eradicate the Shadow Thieves and undermine their Athkatlan operations.  While I have no compuction whatsoever about my duties in regards to this matter, I do wish to avoid causing harm to you, personally.  ~
@6581 = ~(Fade flashes the paladin a sad smile.)  Keldorn, that's very kind of you.  I wish...I wish things didn't have to be the way they are.~
@6582 = ~Aye, as do I, young Fade, as do I.~
@6583 = ~I owe the Shadowmaster a great debt, you know.  I can't just turn my back on him...not after everything he's done for me.~
@6584 = ~That I understand all too well.  It is this very same sense of honor that you have which makes it all the more difficult to be in my position.  I do not wish to be your enemy, Fade, yet I am duty-bound to act against as such.~
@6585 = ~It's okay, Keldorn, I understand.  And I forgive you in advance for all the times you're going to get in my face. I have a feeling that it's going to happen a lot. (Fade smiles conspiratorially and elbows Keldorn in the ribs jokingly) Eh, come on Keldorn, don't worry about it too much.  I promise to give you a merry chase if you promise to let me go at the end of it, okay?~
@6586 = ~Y'know, lassie, I can think of a few *other* things those nible little fingers 'o yers'n be good at, and nay, t'aint fer theivin' neither.~
@6587 = ~Korgan, you're disgusting.  I wouldn't touch the likes of you with a ten-foot spear--~
@6588 = ~(Korgan's bellowing laughter stops Fade in her tracks, and she spins around to face the surly dwarf.)~
@6589 = ~Nay, lassie, I dinnae say what yer likely be thinkin' but I reckon someone with such pretty little hands like yers t'would be far better suited doing needlework or pluckin' away at some musical instrument or other like some silly little pickmedainty, an' leave t' adventurin' t' real fightin' folk like me and <CHARNAME>.~
@6590 = ~(eyes narrowing) Well *I* reckon people with pretty little hands like mine are more than good enough to rip the intestines out of repugnant, vulgar little dwarves like you.~
@6591 = ~Har har har!  An' t' think a fiery temp'rament like yers be wasted on an empty bedroll each night.  Task, tsk.  A shame, 'tis. Aye, a real shame.~
@6592 = ~(Fade grits her teeth and scowls at the dwarf's retreating back.) Ugh!~
@6593 = ~Hey, Mazzy, do you remember that conversation we had about *finding my anchor* and all that? ~
@6594 = ~Vaguely, yes.  I believe I do.  What of it?~
@6595 = ~All this time we've been traveling, I've tried really hard to come up with something I can really truly believe in, but...there isn't anything.~
@6596 = ~That is troubling news indeed, my friend.  Have you truly found nothing -- during all of our travels -- that you might place your faith in, something that you can find comfort in during the direst of trials?~
@6597 = ~Hmm.  Well, does <CHARNAME> count?~
@6598 = ~Such blasphemy!  Fade, you cannot mean that, surely?~
@6599 = ~(A slow smile has spread across Fade's face, and she is obviously enjoying Mazzy's discomfiture.) But if <PROHESHE> becomes a god, it wouldn't be blasphemy anymore, would it?~
@6600 = ~N-no...I suppose not.  I never quite thought about it in quite that perspective.  Now that you mention it, it *does* sound rather odd -- and stragely exciting -- to know that we might be traveling in the presence of a god.  Hmm...I must think on this.~
@6601 = ~It *is* exciting.  Although I'm pretty sure I'll miss <PROHIMHER> when they go.~
@6602 = ~So shall I, Fade.  So shall I.  Come, let us catch up to the others.~
@6603 = ~Uh, Minsc? What in the Nine Hells are you doing?~
@6604 = ~We are gathering your things, friend Fade!  Minsc and Boo agree that little elf girls should not have to carry big heavy bags like this on their own. Boo noticed that we had one free hand, and we thought it could be put to good use. At least, until the next battle, eh?~
@6605 = ~Little *elf* girl..? And why do you think I would need any help? Let me remind you that it was *you* who got into the net trap, a while ago, and struggled so much that it got tangled.~
@6606 = ~Oh, but that was on purpose, wasn't it Boo?  It was so that our foes would think that I was at their mercy, but then Boo would cut through the net with his sharp little teeth, and once we were free, butts would be liberally kicked in good measure!~
@6607 = ~Right...~
@6608 = ~All right, all right.  You can help me if you really want to.  Here, you take this bag, I'll carry this one.~
@6609 = ~Minsc and Boo can take all the bags. We are very strong, you know.~
@6610 = ~Eh, just take this bag. And now we should move on. Just be caref--~
@6611 = ~--careful with my stuff. Eh, nevermind.~
@6612 = ~--and what is it this time, Minsc? Don't get me wrong but it's been a really long <DAYNIGHT>, and I'd rather focus on what we're doing so we can get some rest before I nod off.~
@6613 = ~Boo and I only wanted to say we are very sorry for breaking your little mirror the other day--~
@6614 = ~Oh.  No, it's...it's ok, I know you didn't mean to drop my bag.~
@6615 = ~We were only trying to do something nice for our friend, Fade, and now we feel like we must make it up to you--~
@6616 = ~No, really.  It's all right, you don't have to--~
@6617 = ~--We brought you a present!~
@6618 = ~--You did? Why, Minsc that's awfully nice--~
@6619 = ~(From somewhere within his voluminous backpack, Minsc has produced a small cloth bundle, which he gently places in Fade's proffered hand.) ~
@6620 = ~--Thank you, Minsc-- (The bundle moves) --What...? (It squeaks.) AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!~
@6621 = ~(The bundle goes flying, but Minsc deftly catches it and cradles it gently against his burly chest.  A bewildered-looking squirrel pokes its head out from the cloth bundle and sniffs the air suspiciously before retreating back into it's warm -- and presumably much safer -- cocoon.)~
@6622 = ~You know what, Boo?  I do not think friend Fade likes our present.~
@6623 = ~(*Squeak!*)~
@6624 = ~Oh! Hello Fade. I didn't see you there. Is there something you want? If you're here to needle me again, I want you to know--~
@6625 = ~Gods, Nalia, can't we just have a normal non-hostile conversation for once?~
@6626 = ~I don't know, can we?~
@6627 = ~(sigh) I... Look, there are times when people like you get on my nerves. And you *really* know how to do that. Actually, you've mastered the skill like no one else I've ever met.~
@6628 = ~But you know what?  After traveling with you for a while I've come to realize that there's a lot more to you than I originally gave you credit for.  Now, I'm not saying that I like you. I probably never will.  But I've learned to respect you...for whatever that's worth.~
@6629 = ~(Nalia looks stunned, and it takes her a moment to stammer out a response.) I...uh... well, wow.  That's not at all what I expected you to say.  Er...thank you...I guess.  For whatever that's worth.~
@6630 = ~Ok, let's not oversell this.  It's getting way too awkward. (Fade pauses for a moment, almost like she has something more to say, then abruptly changes her mind and walks away.)~
@6631 = ~Why do you stare at me so, tiefling?  No, do not bother trying to deny it.  I've felt your eyes boring a hole through the back of my head for the last half hour, so whatever it is you have to say, spit it out already lest I wrest it out by force.~
@6632 = ~Was I staring? Hm.  I suppose I was.  It's just that... well, you're...odd.~
@6633 = ~An ironic statement coming from one such as you, demon-spawn.  Surely there is a point to this discussion other than showing me your tenuous grasp of the art of civilized conversation.~
@6634 = ~You don't have to be so sarcastic, Sarevok.  I didn't mean... Well, what I meant is... I guess I thought you and I had something in common, since neither of us really *fit in* anywhere.  I thought maybe--~
@6635 = ~Whatever you *think* is irrelevant.  We have *nothing* in common.~
@6636 = ~How can you say that when you don't know anything about me?~
@6637 = ~Nor do I care to find out.~
@6638 = ~Once again, demon-spawn, I feel your stares upon me. What compels you to provoke me so?~
@6639 = ~I wasn't trying to provoke you.  I just wanted to ask you a question. And this time I won't take *no* for an answer.~
@6640 = ~(sighs wearily) Then you are a fool.  Fearless, but a fool nonetheless.  Very well.  Ask what you will.~
@6641 = ~What's the Abyss like?~
@6642 = ~(Sarevok's face darkens with ill-concealed rage and his eyes narrow dangerously).  I will not answer that. ~
@6643 = ~You said you would answer my question.~
@6644 = ~I said no such thing.  And if you know what's good for you, you will not ask again.~
@6645 = ~But--~
@6646 = ~Fade, do you remember what they say about the cat that overindulged its curiosity?  Yes?  Good.  Let that be the end of it.~
@6647 = ~Sarevok, does it bother you that just about everyone in this group is so quick to judge you based on *what* you are, rather than *who* you are?~
@6648 = ~(sighs wearily) Have I not made it clear that I have no interest in your idiotic ramblings?~
@6649 = ~Yeah, whatever. Just answer the question.~
@6650 = ~(Sarevok looks slightly amused).  So you have a backbone, after all.  No, it does *not* bother me in the least what anyone else thinks.  I remain here at <CHARNAME>'s sufferance, and that is all that matters.  The rest can rot.~
@6651 = ~You're lying.  It *does* matter to you.~
@6652 = ~You know how I know?  It shows in your eyes.  The hurt.  The loneliness.  I know.  Because I feel it too.  Just like you, I've had to kill every one of my siblings who's ever crossed my path.  Like you, people look at me and shudder and turn away.  They whisper behind my back.  I'm not a Bhaalspawn, but I know what it feels like to *not* belong.  I just wanted you to know that.~
@6653 = ~(slowly) Then perhaps we *do* have more in common than I first thought.~
@6654 = ~(viciously) But it changes nothing.  I still think you're a fool.~
@6655 = ~(shrugs) Fine by me. We can still be friends.~
@6656 = ~All right, Fade, what is it now?~
@6657 = ~(Sweetly) Hmm?  Whatever do you mean, Valygar?~
@6658 = ~You're staring at me.  Again. Which means you probably want something.~
@6659 = ~(Shrug) Or maybe it means you have something on your face.~
@6660 = ~I do? (Valygar wipes at his face self-consciously.)  Where?  I don't--~
@6661 = ~(laughing)  You've got a scowl on your face again, you goof!  Come on, Valygar, what's it going to take to make you smile, huh?~
@6662 = ~(Valygar scowls even more -- if that were even possible) Why can't you just leave me be, Fade?~
@6663 = ~Because it's such a waste.  You're much too good-looking to be so surly.~
@6664 = ~Are you...flirting with me?~
@6665 = ~Hells, no!  Do you really think <CHARNAME> would put up with that?~
@6666 = ~No, I don't think so.  But I'm pretty sure he wouldn't mind you leaving me alone, though.~
@6667 = ~(Fade shrugs, and heaves a deep sigh) Yeah, you're probably right about that.  Too bad.  It could've been fun.  (With a wink and a smile, she's gone.)~
@6668 = ~Maybe.~
@6669 = ~Fade--~
@6670 = ~Nothing.  Never mind.  Let's get moving, the others are getting too far ahead.~
@6671 = ~Afraid to be alone with me?~
@6672 = ~Maybe.  Let's go.~
@6673 = ~(With a wink and a smile, Fade makes her way back to the rest of the party, making sure to sway her hips suggestively for Valygar's benefit.)~
@6674 = ~(Sigh)~
@6675 = ~(It's late afternoon and you've called a halt to the day's travels. The company has set up camp, and Valygar sits quietly by the fire, knotting several pieces of rope into snares.  Fade sidles over to him and seats herself next to him on the ground.  Valygar glances at her only briefly, barely pausing to acknowledge her approach.)~
@6676 = ~You're pretty good at that.  I thought rangers were supposed to protect wildlife, not eat them.~
@6677 = ~Sometimes when it's about life or death, you do what you have to, or die.~
@6678 = ~Hm, good point. Say, would you teach me?~
@6679 = ~To make a snare?  Whatever for?  You don't strike me as the...outdoorsy type.~
@6680 = ~Does that mean you won't teach me?~
@6681 = ~(sigh) All right, fine.  I'll teach you.  Come here.~
@6682 = ~(Fade happily slides in closer to Valygar, her thigh pressed against his, watching with rapt attention as his long, nimble fingers work their magic on the rope.  It is several minutes later when she finally looks up at him, eyes shining.)~
@6683 = ~(Valygar, too, finally looks up and blushes hotly when he notices the look of ardor on Fade's face directed at him.) I...uh...you've...  I think...we've practiced enough for today.~
@6684 = ~(He practically leaps to his feet and snatches the snares out of Fade's hands in one deft movement.) We need more firewood.  I'm going to go gather some.  Alone.~
@6685 = ~(A look of disappointment crosses Fade's pretty face momentarily.) All right.  Thank you, Valygar.~
@6686 = ~Here, Valygar, I got this for you.~
@6687 = ~(Fade takes Valygar's hand and into it drops a soft, round and somewhat damp package wrapped in plain brown paper.)~
@6688 = ~(Valygar eyes the package with slight suspicion and makes no move to open it.  Instead, he flashes Fade a questioning look.)~
@6689 = ~You don't have to look at me like that! I promise, whatever's in there won't bite you.  Although, (she adds with a wicked glint in her eye), I might...*if* you ask me nicely.~
@6690 = ~(Fade rolls her eyes and sighs with mild exasperation.) Here. Let *me* open it.~
@6691 = ~...Strawberries?~
@6692 = ~Mm-hm.  A little birdie told me you were fond of these, and that traveling merchant we bumped into yestereve just *happened* to have some!  Aren't you going to eat one?  He swore they'd be sweet and perfectly ripe--~
@6693 = ~Fade, I... Thank you, but I just... I can't.~
@6694 = ~Why not? (Fade's smile fades slightly, giving the impression that she already knows -- but doesn't want to hear-- what he's about to say.)~
@6695 = ~It's <CHARNAME>, isn't it?~
@6696 = ~(Valygar's face is pained, his eyes sorrowful.)  I'm sorry, Fade.  I didn't want to lead you on.~
@6697 = ~You didn't.  It was my fault for playing deaf, blind *and* dumb.~
@6698 = ~Fade-- (Valygar touches her shoulder and squeezes lightly in a vain attempt to comfort her.)~
@6699 = ~Hey, it's ok. (The crushed look in her eyes says otherwise, but she bravely tries to put on a smile.  It doesn't last very long. Her voice catches in her throat as she speaks.)  Let's.. let's catch up to the others, shall we?~
@6700 = ~(Before Valygar can respond, she's gone, walking quickly towards the rest of the group, leaving a sad-looking trail of discarded strawberries on the ground.)~
@6701 = ~It's your gods-damned vow of chastity, isn't it?~
@6702 = ~So you're a fey'ri, huh?~
@6703 = ~Last time I checked, yes I was. Am, I mean.~
@6704 = ~I have to confess I don't know very much about fey'ri, but I *did* meet one before.~
@6705 = ~Really?~
@6706 = ~Well, I always thought fey'ri were an evil race, you know, being part tanar'ri and all...~
@6707 = ~Neera, you've met another fey'ri before?~
@6708 = ~...But you -- well, you don't fit that description at all!  You're actually really, really nice.~
@6709 = ~(Fade beams.) Aw, Neera! That's so sweet of you to say. Thank you. But... tell me about the other fey'ri you met.~
@6710 = ~Oh, *him*.  Yeah.  He was a piece of work, that one.~
@6711 = ~...And...?~
@6712 = ~I'll have to tell you about that some other time.  Look, <CHARNAME> is giving us the stink-eye. We'd better get going.~
@6713 = ~Neera, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying of curiosity.~
@6714 = ~What about?~
@6715 = ~That other fey'ri you said you'd met. Tell me about him.  Please?~
@6716 = ~He wasn't anything like you, that's for sure.~
@6717 = ~Well, for starters, he was a real jerk. Telana had heard rumors about a very powerful and very, very crazy wild mage who was traveling alone along the Dragon Coast, so she tried to bring him back to the sanctuary with her.  For his own protection, of course.~
@6718 = ~I take it that it didn't end well.~
@6719 = ~No, it didn't. He had disguised himself as a moon elf, you see, so when Telana and Hayes first brought him back we all thought he was just this crazy old coot who had a thing for sugared plums, perfectly harmless and perfectly senile.  We were so very, very wrong.~
@6720 = ~What happened?~
@6721 = ~Oh, you know, the usual: he eventually revealed to us his true nature and destroyed half the sanctuary in a fit of explosive rage. Fireballs and reckless dweomers abounded until we managed to subdue him -- at least temporarily -- but he eventually teleported himself away, never to be seen again.~
@6722 = ~Wow. I wonder what caused him to snap like that.~
@6723 = ~We ran out of sugared plums.~
@6724 = ~What?? All that over sugared plums?~
@6725 = ~(Shrugs.) I *did* mention he was crazy.~
@6726 = ~<CHARNAME>, can I talk to you for a minute?~
@6727 = ~Of course, Fade, what's on your mind?~
@6728 = ~Is it important? It's kind of late--~
@6729 = ~Now isn't really a good time, Fade. Maybe later.~
@6730 = ~Well, it's important to *me*. Please, <CHARNAME>, it'll only take a minute.~
@6731 = ~All right then, what's on your mind?~
@6732 = ~I noticed that you and Neera are...close. Very close.~
@6733 = ~I guess you could say that.~
@6734 = ~She's a good friend.~
@6735 = ~*Only* a friend?~
@6736 = ~(Blush.)~
@6737 = ~I don't see how this is any of your business, Fade.~
@6738 = ~So are you two...?~
@6739 = ~Why are you asking me this, Fade?~
@6740 = ~ I guess that's as good an answer as I'm going to get.~
@6741 = ~You're right, it is.~
@6742 = ~I... I don't know. I just thought...hoped...that maybe you and I might have a chance --~
@6743 = ~Is that what you want?~
@6744 = ~We might. I guess we'll have to wait and see.~
@6745 = ~I'm sorry, Fade. I know it's probably not what you wanted to hear, but I can't help what I feel. I just don't feel the same way you do.~
@6746 = ~Maybe. Yes.~
@6747 = ~(Smile at her.) I guess we'll have to wait and see.~
@6748 = ~(Sigh.) Fine. I guess I'll just have to clamor for your attention like everybody else. But don't test my patience, <CHARNAME>, I won't wait forever.~
@6749 = ~All right, then, I guess we're done talking.~
@6750 = ~<CHARNAME>, I know that you and Fade have been spending a lot of time together lately --~
@6751 = ~Yes we have. What of it?~
@6752 = ~I have no idea what you're talking about, Neera.~
@6753 = ~Don't play coy with me, <CHARNAME>. You and I have been spending a lot of time together as well.~
@6754 = ~Yes, we have.  Where are you going with this, Neera?~
@6755 = ~I don't want to talk about this right now, Neera.~
@6756 = ~You can't keep stringing us both along like this, you know. You're going to have to choose one of us sooner or later.~
@6757 = ~How about later, then?~
@6758 = ~Actually, I'd like to know right now.  So who's it going to be, <CHARNAME>?  Me or Fade?~
@6759 = ~If you're going to force me to decide right now, then it's going to be you.~
@6760 = ~If you're going to force me to decide right now, then it's going to be Fade.~
@6761 = ~(Neera smiles in obvious relief.) I'm...so glad. And relieved. Fade is my friend but I have to admit I was getting a little jealous.~
@6762 = ~<CHARNAME>? Let her down easy, okay? I'd hate for her to be hurt any more than she already has, especially on my account.~
@6763 = ~(Neera slowly lets out the breath she had been holding.) Well. All right, then. I guess...I asked for that, didn't I?~
@6764 = ~<CHARNAME>? Be good to her, okay? Fade is my friend, and she deserves to be happy. So do you. Take care of each other.~
@6765 = ~(Groan.) Ugghh!  I feel like we've been walking *forever*! When are we going to stop?~
@6766 = ~Neera, please tell me you have some kind of levitation spell memorized or something...*anything* to make this more bearable!~
@6767 = ~I wish I did. I was tempted to try teleporting on ahead and waiting for you guys to catch up to me somewhere up the road, but the last time I tried something like that it didn't end too well.~
@6768 = ~Oh! But...~
@6769 = ~But what?~
@6770 = ~Maybe we can convince <CHARNAME> to make camp right here.~
@6771 = ~Fat chance of *that* happening. You know that <PRO_HESHE> was talking about being in a hurry to get to...wherever in the hells we're trying to get to.~
@6772 = ~Ah, dearest Fade, you underestimate my *ehem* powers of persuasion. Observe!~
@6773 = ~Neera, what are you doing?~
@6774 = ~It's all right, Fade, I know what I'm doing.~
@6775 = ~(Casts a spell.)~
@6776 = ~...Neera...~
@6777 = ~(Continues casting.)~
@6778 = ~(You have no idea what spell Neera was casting on you, nor does it really matter. All you know is that you are suddenly very, very, VERY sleepy. So sleepy, in fact, that your feet decide -- of their own accord -- that they absolutely refuse to carry you another step. In fact, they refuse to carry you at all.)~
@6779 = ~<CHARNAME>!~
@6780 = ~(You drop to the ground, unconscious. Fade cries out and rushes to you, whimpering helplessly and trying ineffectively to rouse you by slapping your cheeks.)~
@6781 = ~Fade, stop that, you'll hurt <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@6782 = ~(Fade shoots Neera an incredulous look.) Seriously? Neera, you could have killed <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@6783 = ~Well, I didn't. And now we can stop walking, right?~
@6784 = ~Yoohoo! Dorn! Be a dear and help us carry <CHARNAME> to a more...er...comfortable spot, would you?~
@6785 = ~Yoohoo! Sarevok! Be a dear and help us carry <CHARNAME> to a more...er...comfortable spot, would you?~
@6786 = ~Yoohoo! Minsc! Be a dear and help us carry <CHARNAME> to a more...er...comfortable spot, would you?~
@6787 = ~All this time you've been living underneath the city, and nobody knew.~
@6788 = ~Oh, they knew, Fade.  The Shadowmaster knew, but did nothing.~
@6789 = ~I wonder why.  They must have known you were not a part of that vampire coven, otherwise they would have tried to eliminate you.~
@6790 = ~They did.~
@6791 = ~They did?~
@6792 = ~They tried.  And they failed. They failed again and again, until they finally stopped coming.~
@6793 = ~Oh.~
@6794 = ~I've watched you, Hexxat. I've watched the way you work, and your skills are very impressive.~
@6795 = ~Oh? And you, my lovely Fade, have some *skills* which have come to my attention as well...~
@6796 = ~Really? I... oh.  No... not... no. I meant... er, professional skills. (cough)~
@6797 = ~A pity.  But do tell.~
@6798 = ~I just wondered if you had ever considered joining up with the Shadow Thieves.  They are always looking for talented professionals.~
@6799 = ~What makes you think they would ever accept one such as me into their ranks?  I think not.  Aran would never hear of it.~
@6800 = ~I'll talk to him, vouch for you and all that. Give him a chance, Hexxat.  I'll make him see how great you are...~
@6801 = ~I'm flattered by your vote of confidence, Fade, I really am.  But I think it would be best to leave me as... an unaffiliated operative.~
@6802 = ~<CHARNAME>, is there something going on between you and Hexxat?~
@6803 = ~Wow, that was direct. What brought this on?~
@6804 = ~Huh?  What do you mean?~
@6805 = ~We're not discussing this, Fade.~
@6806 = ~You *know* what I mean. So... is there something you want to tell me?~
@6807 = ~I need to know, <CHARNAME>. Please.~
@6808 = ~(Sigh.) I didn't want to tell you like this, but yes, there *is* something between me and Hexxat.~
@6809 = ~(You touch her cheek tenderly and chuckle despite yourself.) No, Fade.  There is *nothing* going on between me and Hexxat.~
@6810 = ~I... see. I have to say, this is pretty morbid, even for you, <CHARNAME>. To each <PRO_HISHER> own I guess.~
@6811 = ~*Whatever you say.*~
@6812 = ~(Fade smiles in relief and leans forward to kiss you on the cheek.) You have no idea how happy that makes me. Now are you going to tell her, or am I?~
@6813 = ~Hexxat, what will you do after all this is over? I mean, once <CHARNAME>'s quest is done and we all go our separate ways...?~
@6814 = ~I haven't given it much thought, to be honest. Why do you ask?~
@6815 = ~I'm just curious, I guess. Now that you and the Shadow Thieves have been...well, *openly introduced*...things can hardly be the same between you and them when you get back to Athkatla.~
@6816 = ~You are right about that. Which is why I am likely not going to return to Athkatla once this is over.~
@6817 = ~Oh. But where will you go?~
@6818 = ~Who knows?  There are many, many possibilities. And there is time enough to decide later.~
@6819 = ~I suppose. There's always the Shadow Thieves, you know.~
@6820 = ~Are you still going on about that? (Chuckle.) Darling Fade, sometimes your singlemindedness is truly...endearing.~
@6821 = ~Rasaad, you mentioned that you grew up in Calimport, am I right?~
@6822 = ~I am from there, yes.~
@6823 = ~You don't talk about it much.~
@6824 = ~There is little to say.  I was yet a boy when I left Calimport, and what few memories I have of that place are not very good ones.~
@6825 = ~I feel the same way.~
@6826 = ~You have been to Calimport?~
@6827 = ~(Fade utters a bitter laugh.) For a while, yes. My pasha was from there.~
@6828 = ~(Rasaad looks slightly confused, but wisely does not speak.)~
@6829 = ~Maybe I'm not ready to talk about this yet. Maybe I'll never be ready.~
@6830 = ~When you are, I will be happy to listen.~
@6831 = ~(Smile.) Thank you, Rasaad. You really are a good friend.~
@6832 = ~(Smiles back.) I thank you for honoring me with such a compliment.~
@6833 = ~His name was... Dominguez.~
@6834 = ~Who?~
@6835 = ~Pasha Dominguez. The man who... bought me.~
@6836 = ~I... see. I cannot say that I know this man, Fade. But then I was only a boy, and knew very little.~
@6837 = ~He was a nobody. A Fat, vile little man who took pleasure in the misery of others. He deserves a slow and painful death.~
@6838 = ~You did not kill him?~
@6839 = ~(Fade frowns and slowly shakes her head.) No. Not yet.~
@6840 = ~I know exactly how you feel.~
@6841 = ~You seek revenge against someone as well, am I right?~
@6842 = ~(Rasaad nods.) Alorgoth.~
@6843 = ~(Fade takes Rasaad's hand in her own and looks him square in the eye.) I hope you find your vengeance, Rasaad.~
@6844 = ~And you as well, my friend.~
@6845 = ~You did not tell me that you were a gladiator.~
@6846 = ~(Fade smiles.) You didn't ask.~
@6847 = ~In Calimport?~
@6848 = ~(Fade nods.) The Arena Efreetum. (Fade shudders.) It was... a horrible place. When I close my eyes I can still remember the smell of sweat and blood and fear that permeated every stone.~
@6849 = ~My father, too, was a gladiator. It was not by choice.~
@6850 = ~It wasn't my choice, either. What happened to him?~
@6851 = ~My father was deeply indebted to too many of the the wrong people. They consigned him to the arena as payment for his debts, and he was forced to fight for his life, and ours.~
@6852 = ~He was good, but not nearly good enough. He was killed.~
@6853 = ~I'm so sorry.~
@6854 = ~I was very young when it happened.  I remember so little of him, and I never knew my mother. After they died, there was only Gamaz.~
@6855 = ~Your brother?~
@6856 = ~Yes. We lived like rats on the streets, stealing to survive until we were caught in the act by a Selunite monk of the Sun Soul. He showed us mercy that day, and instead of punishment we were offered a new life, away from all the dirt and the squalor. I will always be grateful for his intervention. Who knows what would have become of us had he not happened upon us that day?~
@6857 = ~Gamaz might still be alive.~
@6858 = ~(Rasaad falls silent, and too late Fade realizes what she had just said.) Oh, gods... Rasaad I'm so sorry.  I didn't mean it like that!~
@6859 = ~(Rasaad waves away her apology.) I know, Fade. And you are right. Gamaz might yet live had we not joined the Sun Soul order, but...~
@6860 = ~(Rasaad sighs.) There is no changing what is in the past. There is only what can be done to make amends. Come, the others await us, we have lagged behind.~
@6861 = ~He's a good man. A good man, and a good friend.~
@6862 = ~Rasaad? Yes, he is.~
@6863 = ~Rasaad? He's all right, I suppose.~
@6864 = ~Rasaad? Pfeh. He has his uses.~
@6865 = ~Is that all he is to you? A friend?~
@6866 = ~I... No, he's more than that.~
@6867 = ~A very good friend, but yes... Only a friend.~
@6868 = ~I don't see how this is any of your business.~
@6869 = ~That's the most noncommittal answer I've heard out of you yet, <CHARNAME>. But I still need to know.~
@6870 = ~Know what?~
@6871 = ~It *is* my business, <CHARNAME>. Unless you've been stringing me along all this time, I need to know. Do you like him?~
@6872 = ~(You take a moment to think about the implications of her question before replying.) Yes. I *do* like him. A lot.~
@6873 = ~(You take a moment to think about the implications of her question before replying.) You're jealous! Don't worry, it's not like that.~
@6874 = ~That's... rather unkind of you to say, <CHARNAME>. I did notice that you two spend a lot of time together. Alone.~
@6875 = ~Nothing wrong with that, is there? I happen to like the guy.~
@6876 = ~This is really one of your busines, Fade.~
@6877 = ~You like him, huh? A lot?~
@6878 = ~I... understand. I don't blame you, really.~
@6879 = ~Look out for him, <CHARNAME>. If you don't, he just might get himself killed. Or worse.~
@6880 = ~I will. And Fade? I'm very, very sorry.~
@6881 = ~Fine. Now, let's move on.~
@6882 = ~(She grins widely, clearly relieved.) I guess I *was* a little jealous.~
@6883 = ~You're going to have to tell him, <CHARNAME>. You can't lead him on like this.~
@6884 = ~I will. And Fade? I promise, I'll be gentle.~
@6885 = ~Good. Now, let's go.~
@6886 = ~Rasaad, here, have some of this.~
@6887 = ~(He glances curiously at the small flask of ale Fade proffers in his direction.) Golden Sands lager! Fade, this is... rather unexpected. To what do I owe this honor?~
@6888 = ~I was told that this is Calimshite beer. More specifically, from Calimport, the innkeeper said.~
@6889 = ~It is indeed. Did you get this in Saradush? (Fade nods.) I'm surprised he even had this in stock. This is not a common beverage to find, let alone in a city under siege.~
@6890 = ~I hoped it would give you a little taste of home.~
@6891 = ~(Rasaad smiles sadly and shakes his head.) Calimport has not been *home* in a very long time, Fade. (Fade's face crumples slightly, but Rasaad is quick to reassure her.) It was still a very thoughtful gesture, my friend. I thank you.~
@6892 = ~Are you going to drink it?~
@6893 = ~Only if you join me.~
@6894 = ~(Beaming widely, Fade pulls another flask out of her pack.) I thought you'd never ask.~
@6895 = ~To friends new and old--~
@6896 = ~... (*swig*)...~
@6897 = ~--To legends unforged, and stories yet untold! (As if by some unspoken cue, they both raise their flasks in your direction before taking a deep, satisfying drink.)~
@6898 = ~To <CHARNAME>!~
@6899 = ~To <CHARNAME>. May we live to see the end of this story.~
@6900 = ~<CHARNAME>, we have to get out of here! We'll be buried alive if we don't!~
@6901 = ~Is it what you had hoped it would be?~
@6902 = ~(He cocks his head to one side, looking very puzzled.) What is?~
@6903 = ~Revenge. What does it feel like?~
@6904 = ~(There is a very long, very pregnant pause.)~
@6905 = ~Rasaad?~
@6906 = ~It is... empty.~
@6907 = ~Not what you hoped it would be?~
@6908 = ~(He shakes his head, no.)~
@6909 = ~What will you do now?~
@6910 = ~Follow <CHARNAME> to the end, whatever that end might be.~
@6911 = ~And then?~
@6912 = ~(He shrugs tiredly.) I don't know. Perhaps I am not meant to survive until the end, but I will go for as long as I am able.~
@6913 = ~(Fade smiles and touches Rasaad's shoulder.) Of course you'll survive.~
@6914 = ~(Smiling back.) Then I suppose we shall have to wait and see what comes after the end, won't we?~
@6915 = ~Cease your malcontent mutterings, Pixie. It is not my problem that my presence unsettles you so.~
@6916 = ~*Unsettled* isn't the word for it. *Disgusted*, more like.~
@6917 = ~(Scoffs) For a Shadow Thief you have a pitifully weak stomach for mayhem. With your heritage I would have expected much more from you. Such a disappointment.~
@6918 = ~You know *nothing* of my heritage!~
@6919 = ~As a matter of fact, I do. Or have you forgotten who my patron is?~
@6920 = ~(Fade snorts) Oh, yes. Your *patron*. Your *master*. The one who pulls your leash.~
@6921 = ~Says the one who simpers and licks the Shadowmaster's bootstraps. I serve my patron because it benefits me, for now. *You* are the one who disgusts *me*! You have turned your back on everything that makes you who you are, and you are all the weaker for it. The rest of your kind embrace the power that is in their blood, but you -- you are nothing without your precious Aran and his pathetic Shadow Thieves.~
@6922 = ~Do you even realize how absolutely INFURIATING you are? And stop calling me pixie, I *hate* it.~
@6923 = ~Pixie.~
@6924 = ~Grrr! You're insufferable! I just don't understand why <CHARNAME> keeps you around!~
@6925 = ~Because I am stong, I complement <PRO_HISHER> power, and I am a warrior of great worth. Only a fool would fail to see that.~
@6926 = ~Don't delude yourself.~
@6927 = ~(Snicker) Think what you like. In the end, your opinion of me matters not; I am here because <CHARNAME> wills it, *PIXIE*.~
@6928 = ~(*Huff!*)~
@6929 = ~What-- what is this!?~
@6930 = ~*These* are arrows. They're like sticks, but with feathers and sharp, pointy ends. You use them with a bow.~
@6931 = ~Do not treat me like an imbecile, thief, I *know* what they are.  I want to know *why* you're waving those arrows in my face.~
@6932 = ~Well, first of all, they make a definite improvement. But more importantly, I was trying to imagine how you might look with a couple of these sticking out of your forehead.  I have to be honest -- my imagined version just isn't quite cutting it, so I might need to see the real thing.~
@6933 = ~(Growling.) You little wretch!~
@6934 = ~Easy, Dorn. Tsk, tsk!~
@6935 = ~(In a low voice) You'd better watch that temper of yours, Dorn, or it might just get you killed.~
@6936 = ~And *you* should watch your vicious little tongue, bitch, or I might just rip it out of your head.~
@6937 = ~I'm not afraid of you, *blackguard*.  You would never harm me.~
@6938 = ~I wouldn't be too sure about that.~
@6939 = ~If you're stupid enough to tangle with one of the Shadow Thieves, then by all means, be my guest. You're certainly welcome to try.~
@6940 = ~Do you really think that being the Shadowmaster's little strumpet is going to save you from *me*?~
@6941 = ~I doubt it, but the consequences will be... inconvenient. You wouldn't do it.~
@6942 = ~You're wrong.~
@6943 = ~We'll see about that.~
@6944 = ~Watch yourself, Dorn.  The Shadow Thieves have eyes, and they are always watching. You touch one hair on my head, and they will destroy you.~
@6945 = ~Hahaha! Not likely. You're a fool to believe that a blade in the dark will take down Dorn Il-Khan.~
@6946 = ~Not a blade. Secrets.  We know all about you, and that knowledge is how we will destroy you.~
@6947 = ~And I will take you down with me, Pixie.  Mark my words.~
@6948 = ~<CHARNAME>, if you do this we'll have every guard in the city hunting our hides! It's not worth it!~
@6949 = ~<CHARNAME>, there's something we need to talk about.~
@6950 = ~Of course, Fade. What's bothering you?~
@6951 = ~All right, but make it quick. We're on a tight schedule here.~
@6952 = ~I don't have time for this right now, Fade.~
@6953 = ~I've seen you and Dorn together a lot lately. What's going on with you two?~
@6954 = ~How about I just get straight to the point? You. Dorn. What's going on?~
@6955 = ~Well, how about you *make* time? I need to know what's going on between you and Dorn.~
@6956 = ~Well?~
@6957 = ~We're good friends. You may not like him, but I do. Get over it.~
@6958 = ~Not your business. Don't ask about it again.~
@6959 = ~Hrmph. You're even starting to sound like him. Maybe the two of you deserve each other.~
@6960 = ~Come on, Fade, don't be like that. He's my friend, and he's good to have around. Besides, I actually like the guy.~
@6961 = ~We're done talking about this. Don't ask me about this again.~
@6962 = ~I don't like it, <CHARNAME>, but if you insist, then... whatever. Just make sure you set some boundaries with him, or else.~
@6963 = ~Fine! I won't ask anymore. Better yet, I won't even SPEAK to you anymore!~
@6964 = ~*What* are you snickering at, you foolish little snippet?~
@6965 = ~Oh, nothing, I just... well, I overheard you mention that Gromnir is -- or rather, *was* -- your cousin, am I right?~
@6966 = ~He was of the same tribe as I, but our genetic connection was tenuous at best. What of it?~
@6967 = ~Well, now I understand where you get it from.~
@6968 = ~You had better start making sense, Pixie, or I'll gut you where you stand and decorate the Pocket Plane with your entrails.~
@6969 = ~You wouldn't and you know it.~
@6970 = ~Try me.~
@6971 = ~Yeah, yeah, whatever. It sure does run in the family.~
@6972 = ~What does? SPEAK, damn you, I grow impatient!~
@6973 = ~Insanity. Power-hunger. Delusions of grandeur. Oh, yeah, and a terrible temper.~
@6974 = ~(Growls dangerously). <CHARNAME>... I suggest you put your pet strumpet in her place, lest I lose control of my *temper* and shove it up her--~
@6975 = ~(Fade scoots away out of arm's reach, still giggling at the infuriated Dorn.)~
@6976 = ~I still find it preposterous that your almighty patron would send you all this way to piss on a tree. I mean, really?~
@6977 = ~I would never expect you to understand, Pixie. Leave me be.~
@6978 = ~You're right about one thing. I *don't* understand. It was a ridiculous and petty errand, beneath even you.~
@6979 = ~There is some truth to your words, much as I hate to admit it. The task was certainly beneath me.~
@6980 = ~Then why did you do it?~
@6981 = ~You would never understand.~
@6982 = ~You keep *saying* that, but you never explain anything! Of *course* I don't understand.~
@6983 = ~I owe explanations to no one, least of all you.~
@6984 = ~You owe one to <CHARNAME>.~
@6985 = ~If <PRO_HESHE> wishes to discuss it, then I shall do so. With <PRO_HIMHER> only, not to you. Now leave me be.~
@6986 = ~Fine. Be that way. I *still* think it's ridiculous.~
@6987 = ~You were in there a *really* long time, <CHARNAME>.  What exactly did that woman want with you?~
@6988 = ~She wanted teach me how to use my abilities more effectively.~
@6989 = ~Fade, she taught me some of the most amazing things a woman can do to a man!~
@6990 = ~I realized that all she wanted to do was bed me, so I left.~
@6991 = ~Uh-huh. So what did she teach you, hmm?~
@6992 = ~She WHAT??!! Oh, you *dog*! No, let's not talk about it anymore. I just want to go.~
@6993 = ~Oh, *really*? Hrrmph. Well, I'm glad the bitch didn't get what she wanted.  Let's go.~
@6994 = ~Don't lie to me, <CHARNAME>. I heard every sound that came from behind that door. I think everyone in Athkatla did. No, let's not talk about it anymore. I just want to go.~
@6995 = ~Apparently a life-sized statue in the middle of town and a shower of riches wasn't reward enough for you, according to Guildmistress Busya, eh?~
@6996 = ~We went for a walk so she could show me the town. It was nice.~
@6997 = ~We went to the inn for a couple of drinks and a dance. It was fun.~
@6998 = ~We spent the night together. It was wonderful.~
@6999 = ~Whatever, *Hero of Trademeet*. I don't even want to talk about it.~
@7000 = ~Well. You're looking positively... ~
@7001 = ~Clean?~
@7002 = ~Scrubbed?~
@7003 = ~Relaxed?~
@7004 = ~That's not exactly what I was going to say, but now that you mention it...~
@7005 = ~I took a bath, Fade. I thought you might appreciate the fact that I no longer smell like an ox that's been plowing the fields all day.~
@7006 = ~Interesting choice of words. I wonder though -- *have* you been plowing the... field? Actually -- don't answer that. It's better that I don't know.~
@7007 = ~And, <CHARNAME>? I think it's time to find you a decent butler.~
@7008 = ~That little hussy was *so* lucky that I didn't leap over the table and dig her eyes out with my spoon for looking at you the way she did.~
@7009 = ~You're overreacting, Fade. Ilona is a nice girl and perfectly harmless.~
@7010 = ~What can I say? I'm irresistible.~
@7011 = ~Harmless my foot! Or should I say *her* foot? Oh, I *know* what was going on under that table, <CHARNAME>, don't even bother trying to deny it. (Fade walks away, muttering angrily under her breath.)~
@7012 = ~You are such a cad sometimes, you know?  You probably would have slept with her, too, if you had half a chance. No, <CHARNAME>, don't even bother trying to deny it. (Fade walks away, muttering angrily under her breath.)~
@7013 = ~Ah, there he is, the dancing fool. Did the pretty redhead provide enough distraction for you?~
@7014 = ~Why, Fade! Is that jealousy I hear in your voice?~
@7015 = ~Well, if you would just dance with me once in a while I wouldn't need another *pretty redhead* to keep me company, now would I?~
@7016 = ~I know of *one* pretty redhead that provides constant distraction. (Touch her cheek.)~
@7017 = ~Oh, back off, Fade. I'm tired of your snide comments and innuendo. (Walk away.)~
@7018 = ~And what if it is? What are you going to do about it?.~
@7019 = ~This. (Plant a chaste kiss on her cheek.)~
@7020 = ~This. (Plant a soft kiss on her lips.)~
@7021 = ~This. (Plant a light kiss on her forehead and walk away.)~
@7022 = ~Hrrmph.  You *know* I don't dance, <CHARNAME>.~
@7023 = ~Maybe you should try it sometime. I'll even teach you. (Smile.)~
@7024 = ~Well, Sheri was an excellent dancer, but she isn't you. No one else is.~
@7025 = ~Oh, well. Your loss.  (Walk away.)~
@7026 = ~(Fade smiles sweetly at you and sighs.) All right. You're forgiven.~
@7027 = ~(Fade looks at you, her eyes shining.) You always know exactly how to make me feel better.~
@7028 = ~(Fade says nothing, but you can almost feel the daggers she shoots at your retreating back.)~
@7029 = ~<CHARNAME>, did you and Solaufein... Oh, gods... Please tell me you didn't...!~
@7030 = ~Haven't you seen the way Phaere looks at me? Maybe if I convince her that I prefer the company of men she just might leave me... us... alone.~
@7031 = ~Can you blame me? He's a fine specimen, and I simply couldn't pass up the opportunity.~
@7032 = ~It's not what you think, Fade.  We drank, we talked. Nothing more.~
@7033 = ~I'm really not happy about this, <CHARNAME>. I can't wait to leave this horrible place.  If I never see the Underdark again, it'll be too soon.~
@7034 = ~Your behaviour is so thoroughly disgusting sometimes, <CHARNAME>. I can't wait to leave this horrible place.  If I never see the Underdark again, it'll be too soon.~
@7035 = ~I can't believe you fell for that.~
@7036 = ~Fell for what?~
@7037 = ~(Fade adopts an exaggeratedly high-pitched, mocking tone.) Oh, my heroic <PRO_LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>, will you puh-LEASE help meeeee! I simply MUST speak with you in PRIVATE! Alone! (And probably naked, too.  Oh, gods, I'm starting to sound like Edwin.)~
@7038 = ~Oh, come on, Fade you're being terribly unkind. She's just a young girl with a lot on her mind.~
@7039 = ~Uh-huh.  Far too much on her mind and far too little on her body.  Namely, clothing.  Since when do acolytes wear such short skirts??~
@7040 = ~Nothing happened, okay? You're overreacting. As usual.~
@7041 = ~Overreacting, am I? I'll show you overreacting! You have *no* idea what overreacting is, *<CHARNAME>*, you just wait and see...~
@7042 = ~(You sigh heavily as the realization sinks in: you're not going to hear the end of this anytime soon.)~
@7043 = ~(Between gritted teeth) Once this charade is over, that bitch is going to be the first one to die.~
@7044 = ~So... what did she say to you?~
@7045 = ~Hmm?~
@7046 = ~It was a little...strange.~
@7047 = ~She said I was going to die.~
@7048 = ~(Fade snaps her fingers in front of your face, a glint of impatience in her eyes.) Hey! Eyes over here, <CHARNAME>. What did she say to you?~
@7049 = ~(Fade snorts derisively and tosses her crimson hair.) Well, most Rom are a little touched in the head to begin with anyway. What did she say to you?~
@7050 = ~Did she now? Hrmph. Well I guess we're just going to have to make sure that doesn't happen. Unless, of course, I kill you myself.~
@7051 = ~(Having espied your little exchange with Chandra, Fade shoots you what is quite possibly the dirtiest and most annoyed you have ever seen. You reply with a look of feigned innocence but she simply shakes her head and walks away without a word.)~
@7052 = ~The amulet was intended for Fade's exclusive use. Your action, in the eyes of the law, may constitute criminal misappropriation, punishable by imprisonment for a term not less than six months and not more than five years and also by a fine.~
@7053 = ~The amulet was intended for the exclusive use of Fade and <CHARNAME>. Your action, in the eyes of the law, may constitute criminal misappropriation, punishable by imprisonment for a term not less than six months and not more than five years and also by a fine.~
@7054 = ~You rush to the portal, only to have it close just as you reach it. Lying on the ground is your only clue to what happened--a partially torn piece of parchment.~
@7055 = ~I won't stand for this, <CHARNAME>! I'm leaving, now!~
@7056 = ~Certainly under *most* circumstances, the beginning of a new life is a thing to celebrate. Our current situation, however, would have -- SHOULD have -- warranted far more care and foresight. (Sigh). Now we can do nothing more but try to keep Fade and the baby safe.~
@7057 = ~(Growl) As if we didn't have enough problems to worry about, now we have to deal with this! Perhaps it will be safer to send Fade back to the Pocket Plane and have her wait for us there, where she'll be safe and out of the way.  Her unfortunate condition--~
@7058 = ~Safe? Out of the way?? *Unfortunate* condition??? You--~
@7059 = ~I'm only trying to... Oh, never mind, you never listen anyway.~
@7060 = ~Ohhhh, a baby! This is cause for a celebration, for certain! You're going to need to keep up your strength, now that you're going to have a baby. You know my great-uncle Phinneas' sister Felicity had 12 babies?  Not all at the same time, of course, although twins and the occassional set of triplets were not altogether uncommon on her side of the family. Why, my cousin Jemima -- that's Aunt Felicity's second-to-youngest daughter -- even had quintuplets, wouldn't you know! It must have been a trial having so many babies all at once, but Cousin Jemima was a trooper, sure as the nose on my face, she was!~
@7061 = ~Jan...~
@7062 = ~ ...but anyhow, as I was saying, my Aunt Felicity had this special soup she used to make... she made it for herself, first, of course, then she taught her recipe to each of her daughters... my cousins, you know...~
@7063 = ~...Jan... I don't--~
@7064 = ~...strangely enough, not actually made with turnips, but oat mash and rutabagas...~
@7065 = ~...Jan, I'm not... (sigh)... nevermind...~
@7066 = ~So you simply couldn't wait until this matter of your heritage was done and settled before you foisted yourself upon your little demon whore. Or... are you trying to emulate our late sire by sowing your seed in much the same manner as he did before he died? How very foolish of you, brother. Now, if you should you perish in your attempt to claim our father's throne or claim it, there shall be yet another crop of tainted broodlings to take up your mantle and history will yet again repeat itself. Stupid fool!~
@7067 = ~Shut up, Sarevok! Spew your bile somewhere else, I don't want to hear it!~
@7068 = ~I was speaking to my *brother*, trollop, and if you do not care to hear what I have to say then by all means walk away. I will not hold my tongue on *your* account.~
@7069 = ~Hrrmph!~
@7070 = ~Spittin' yon lassie on yer lance I understand, but this business o' wee bairns be bad news, an' away more trouble than be worth it methinks! This here little firebrand be the death of ye, <CHARNAME>, ye be markin' me words.~
@7071 = ~Well, so it seems our fair raven and his little firefinch have deigned to build their nest in the very eye of the hurricane! How very delectably chaotic, and most certainly ill-advised under our present circumstances, aye? (*sigh*) 'Tis no secret that I myself am sorely averse to the seeding progeny, however, I am not so deluded as to presume that my opinions matter aught, therefore it remains only to protect yon mother-hen as best we can until such time as our quest is concluded and we are forced asunder -- by death or entropy or both.~
@7072 = ~Like the seeds of a great oak that fall too close to a roaring river, this babe has chosen to grasp at life amid the churning turmoil of its father's destiny. I shall strive as best I can to be the stalwart rock which shelters the young sapling in its lee until the fragile tendrils have taken root more deeply.~
@7073 = ~(Smile) Thank you, Cernd.~
@7074 = ~Do you hear that, Boo? Soon we will have another little companion to play and kick butts with! Oh, this is very, very exciting! Happy, happy day! Once more Boo will have to share his stash of nuts, for that is what good hamsters do, is it not?~
@7075 = ~Uh, Minsc... the baby won't be able to eat nuts for quite a while.~
@7076 = ~No nuts? What kind of person does not eat nuts? That is not right!~
@7077 = ~Well, the baby won't have any teeth for at least the first year--~
@7078 = ~What? No teeth! Oh, this cannot be! Boo, did you hear that?  The baby will have no teeth! How can he become a great warrior with no teeth?  Oh, sad, sad day!~
@7079 = ~No, Minsc, I mean... (shakes her head and sighs) You know, never mind.~
